<!--
Draft: Structure A+ (Dev-focused, governance-aware) — English
Date: 2026-05-28
Variant of README_A — adopts a colleague's advice on the contribution section
(see local note: README_advice.md, advice items #3, #4, #6). Clone-URL advice
(#2) intentionally skipped per the user. AI-assistant callout (#1) tried and
removed — the Contributing & governance section at the bottom already covers
the AI-friendly story.

Changes vs README_A.en.md:
  - First-screen "Found a bug / need help?" sub-line under the lang switch (#6)
  - "## Contributing" rewritten as "## Contributing & governance" — navigation
    only, links to AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / GOVERNANCE.md / MAINTAINERS.md /
    CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md / SECURITY.md / .mindflow/_overview.md, ends with
    git-shortlog line (#3 + #4). Verbose "I made a template / Module / change
    the code" sub-sections collapsed — those belong in CONTRIBUTING.md.

##  Get started in 60 seconds

NarraNexus is a multi-agent product — not yet another framework where you wire agents together, but a ready-to-run team of agents that already collaborate. Three deployment paths — pick whichever suits you.

### ☁️ Cloud sign-up — fastest, with a free trial quota

1. Open [agent.narra.nexus](https://agent.narra.nexus/login)
2. Sign up
3. Pick a template and go

<!-- TODO: cloud sign-up demo video, ~30s -->

> [!NOTE]
> **Running locally (desktop app or source)?** Two things to know:
> - **Bring your own LLM API key.** The desktop app and local build run on your own key — use a Claude Code login, or grab a NetMind.AI Power key (one key, takes a minute). Configure it under **Settings** — see [Configure LLM Providers](https://narra.nexus/docs/getting-started/quick-start).
> - **Free up local ports.** Both run several local services; make sure those ports aren't already taken.

### 💻 macOS desktop app

The app bundles its own runtime — no Python / Node / Docker to install.

1. [Download the app](https://github.com/NetMindAI-Open/NarraNexus/releases/latest)
2. Drag it into the Applications folder
3. Launch → pick a template and go

<!-- TODO: dmg install demo video, ~30s -->

### 🛠️ From source (developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NetMindAI-Open/NarraNexus.git
cd NarraNexus
bash run.sh
```

`run.sh` checks prerequisites (`uv` / `node` / `tmux`) and launches all local services. For the full service/port list and detailed setup, see the [dev docs](https://narra.nexus/docs/getting-started/quick-start).

##  Three Core Features

### What an agent actually does for you.

<p align="center">

##  Reference Templates

Reference implementations — use them directly, or fork to customize.

### Financial Morning Briefing

For investors and analysts who read markets at 7am. **6 agents** deliver an analyst-grade HTML briefing to your inbox daily at 08:00 Asia/Shanghai. Not yet another news summary — a structured read on *"what is the market trading today, and should I attack, defend, or watch?"*

**[narra.nexus/templates/financial-morning-briefing →](https://www.narra.nexus/templates/financial-morning-briefing)**

<!-- TODO: Financial Morning Briefing template demo video, ~30s -->

### KOL Assistant

For content creators juggling inbound sponsorships. **4 agents** parse incoming sponsor emails, keep your CRM up to date, and monitor brand mentions across social platforms — so you spend time on the next video, not on inbox triage.

**[narra.nexus/templates/kol-assistant →](https://www.narra.nexus/templates/kol-assistant)**

<!-- TODO: KOL Assistant template demo video, ~30s -->

### PM Bridge Bot

For teams juggling internal team chat and external client communication. A single bot maintains two searchable knowledge bases — internal-only and client-shared — and auto-files every chat, doc, and meeting note into the right scope. Tone adapts per audience; language is auto-detected.

##  Honest Limitations

- **LLM API key**: the cloud version has a free trial quota. For daily or local use, you'll want your own LLM API key — one or two minutes to register at NetMind, OpenAI, or Anthropic.
- **An agent isn't 100% out of the box**: it needs your corrections and feedback to get sharp. Treat it like a new hire, not a god.
- **Collaboration isn't perfect on the first try**: complex tasks may take a couple of iterations before agents get the hang of it; some judgment calls always belong to you — the team handles the bulk, the key calls stay with you.
- **Architecture trade-off**: each agent launches its own MCP process, adding ~100ms of startup overhead. Negligible for chat-style workflows; switch to Direct Trigger mode for high-frequency jobs.

##  Contributing & governance

NarraNexus is built to work well with human and AI-agent contributors alike.

**Start here:**

- New contributors → [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- AI coding assistants → [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) (vendor-neutral) or [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) directly
- Project map for your AI agent → [`.mindflow/_overview.md`](./.mindflow/_overview.md)

**How the project is run:**

- Governance & maintainer team → [`GOVERNANCE.md`](./GOVERNANCE.md), [`MAINTAINERS.md`](./MAINTAINERS.md)
- Community standards → [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Security policy → [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md)

See [`MAINTAINERS.md`](./MAINTAINERS.md) for the current maintainer team. Run `git shortlog -sn` for the full contributor list.

Other candidates considered:

Merged hook (for boss's review):
  "Most agent tools are built for developers. NarraNexus is built for everyone else."
