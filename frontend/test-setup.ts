/**
 * Vitest global setup — runs before every test module's imports.
 *
 * Why this file exists: jsdom (the default vitest environment) does
 * not implement window.matchMedia, but several stores in this repo
 * call it at module-init time (notably themeStore, transitively
 * loaded by Markdown). Without this stub, any test that imports
 * anything that touches the theme system would fail before any
 * test code runs.
 *
 * Also extends vitest's `expect` with @testing-library/jest-dom matchers
 * (toBeInTheDocument, toHaveAttribute, toHaveTextContent, etc.) used by
 * NM primitive component tests in components/nm/__tests__/.

// is then "not a function", so every test with a `beforeEach(localStorage.clear)`
// fails before running. Install a small in-memory Storage whenever the global
// one is missing or incomplete, so the suite is independent of the Node build.
