 * @description: framework id → brand mark, plus the two rendering fallbacks
 * the directory and the profile page rely on. LABELS ARE NOT DEFINED HERE:
 * they are forwarded from `agentFramework.AGENT_FRAMEWORKS`, the list the
 * framework pickers already render — so the directory column, the profile
 * card and the settings dropdown can never disagree on a name.
 *
 * The Dashboard directory and the Agent Profile page each carried their own
 * label + icon map, and the two had already drifted once (one knew
 * `nexus_power`, the other did not — tsc said nothing). The first cut of this
 * module fixed that by adding a THIRD label table, which disagreed with the
 * pickers on two of three names ("Codex" vs "Codex CLI") — the same page could
 * show both. Deriving from the picker list is the actual fix.
 *
 * Two behaviours callers rely on, both deliberate:
 *   - an UNKNOWN id is title-cased from the raw string, never mapped to some
 *     other brand — "unknown but present" beats "wrong";
 *   - a MISSING id (undefined) renders as '—' and the generic Bot glyph. The
 *     backend leaves it undefined for agents whose configuration is not the
 *     viewer's to see; inventing a default here would show a brand the agent
 *     may not be running on.
 *
 * Read the bare `AGENT_FRAMEWORKS`, never `availableFrameworks()`: the latter
 * is filtered by what the current user's providers can back, and an agent
 * running a framework this user cannot pick must still be labelled truthfully.
