/**
 * Which tool calls are the agent speaking to its owner.
 *
 * There are two names for one destination — `reply_owner` when the owner is
 * the one who spoke and is waiting, `notify_owner` when the owner is not part
 * of what is happening and is being interrupted. The agent's desk carries
 * exactly one per turn (see ChatModule.get_expressive_tools on the backend),
 * so the frontend can never assume which one a given turn produced.
 *
 * Anything that answers "did the owner receive something" must accept BOTH.
 * Matching one name only was the pre-split shape of this check and it is
 * silently wrong on every turn that used the other: the reply is real, the
 * content is there, and the bubble simply never renders.
 *
 * Mirrors `_OWNER_TOOL_RE` in
 * `src/xyz_agent_context/channel/message_source_handler.py` — the two must move
 * together. (This comment said `chat_module/chat_module.py` until 2026-08-18; a
 * dangling pointer in the one comment whose whole job is keeping two copies in
 * sync is worse than no pointer, because it is followed.)
