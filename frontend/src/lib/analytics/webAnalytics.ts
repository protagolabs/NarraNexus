 * @date: 2026-08-12
 * @description: Consent-gated loader for Google Tag Manager (web surface only).
 *
 * GTM is NOT hardcoded in index.html. Loading it from code enforces gates an
 * inline <head> tag cannot:
 *
 *   1. Consent (single source of truth). Loads only after
 *      api.getAnalyticsOptOut() confirms the logged-in user has not opted out
 *      (Settings → Privacy, the "Product analytics" toggle whose copy now
 *      discloses this third-party analytics). Fail-closed on any error. Because
 *      opt-out is per-user, App.tsx calls this only once isLoggedIn. If a
 *      DIFFERENT, opted-out user later logs in in the same tab, a script tag
 *      can't be un-loaded, so we reload to shed it. Turning the toggle off
 *      mid-session reloads too (see PrivacySettings.toggleAnalytics, which also
 *      calls markWebAnalyticsConsentRevoked() to close the in-flight window).
 *   2. Desktop safety. isTauri() short-circuits — nothing loads inside the
 *      Tauri webview (csp: null + withGlobalTauri: true).
 *   3. Host + config gate. getWebAnalyticsConfig() returns a non-empty id only
 *      on the official production host (agent.narra.nexus); dev / CI / desktop /
 *      self-hosts send nothing. (An injected /config.js `gtmId` key or a
 *      VITE_GTM_ID build value can also supply it, but NO deploy injects one
 *      today — production's only live source is the host + a compiled-in
 *      constant. The immediate off-switch is the GTM console, not a redeploy.)
 *
 * Ownership: the GTM container is maintained by protagolabs; its tags/triggers
 * are configured in the GTM console, not in this repo.
 *
 * Related: first-party product events go through lib/productAnalytics.ts (a
 * separate, backend-DB path, no vendor). New client-side analytics files belong
 * in this lib/analytics/ subpackage.
 *
 * Clarity (session replay) is intentionally NOT loaded here: in a conversation
 * product its DOM-snapshot replay would capture chat content, contradicting the
 * localized "never collect conversation content" promise. GTM is event-only.
 *
 * Separate from the kernel analytics seam (src/xyz_agent_context/analytics,
 * whose cloud PostHog sink stays NullSink) — see that module's docstring.

 *  path where GTM never loaded (opt-out lookup failed → fail-closed) the flag
 *  lingers until the next full page load. That only ever UNDER-loads (a
 *  re-enabled user waits until reload), never over-loads — the safe direction.
