 * @description: One agent, one colour, on every surface that shows it.
 *
 * A team room with six members is unreadable if every message is the same grey:
 * the only thing separating two agents today is a 10px name above the bubble,
 * and on mobile not even that. Colour is what makes a multi-party transcript
 * scannable.
 *
 * That only works if the colour is an IDENTITY — stable across the room, the
 * inbox and the dashboard. It was not. Two copies of this hash existed
 * (`AgentInboxPanel.senderColor` and `dashboard/SessionSection.colorForSeed`)
 * and they had ALREADY diverged: both open green/sky/yellow/rose/violet, then
 * one continues teal/indigo/fuchsia and the other fuchsia/teal/indigo. Any
 * agent hashing into slots 5-7 was showing two different colours in two places,
 * with nothing anywhere to make that visible. Adding a third copy for the team
 * room would have made it three.
 *
 * Seeded on the AGENT ID, never the display name: renaming an agent must not
 * change its colour, and a rename is precisely when a reader most needs the
 * colour to stay put. It also leaves room for "let the user pick a colour"
 * later as an override at read time, with no data migration.

 * Ordering is load-bearing — it is what makes the colour stable across
 * releases, so rows are appended, never inserted or reordered.
