/**
 * @file_name: no-unauthenticated-api-fetch.test.ts
 * @description: Components must not call /api/ with a raw fetch().
 *
 * Local mode rejects any /api/ request without identity headers. `lib/api`
 * attaches them; a bare `fetch('/api/…')` does not — and the 401 that follows
 * arrives as a thrown/odd body that call sites routinely mistake for a normal
 * negative answer.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. On 2026-09-22 the browser settings pane used a raw
 * fetch, and its 401 surfaced as "browser not installed" next to an install
 * button that did nothing when clicked. Both the status and the action were
 * being rejected; neither said so.
 *
 * A per-component test cannot catch this — each one stubs the fetch it is
 * testing. Only a scan over the source can, and only a scan covers files that
 * have not been written yet. Same reasoning as
 * `lib/__tests__/no-native-dialogs.test.ts`.
