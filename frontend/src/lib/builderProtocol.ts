 * @description: The wire format between the creation studio's chat and its
 * configuration panel.
 *
 * Outbound: every message the user sends while the studio is open is wrapped
 * with the builder instruction plus the target agent's CURRENT configuration.
 * Restating the config each turn is what makes the user's own manual edits
 * authoritative — the model sees what the panel actually holds, so it revises
 * instead of overwriting.
 *
 * Inbound: the model appends exactly one `<agent_draft>` block. The frontend
 * strips it before render, parses it, validates it against a whitelist, and
 * applies the field diff to the real agent.
 *
 * Three failure modes are handled here because they are not hypothetical —
 * they are what a weaker model actually does, and binding rule #15 says the
 * platform does not police the user's choice of model:
 *
 *   1. Streaming shows an OPEN tag long before the close tag arrives, so the
 *      strip must also kill an unterminated block. Matching only the closed
 *      form scrolls raw JSON past the reader on every single turn.
 *   2. CLI-style models emit real newlines inside JSON strings when the value
 *      is Markdown. A second parse attempt escapes control characters inside
 *      string literals only — object structure still has to be valid JSON.
 *   3. Anything unrecognised is dropped rather than trusted: skill ids not in
 *      the caller's catalogue, channels outside the supported set, missing
 *      fields. Fail-closed, and a parse failure degrades to "no config change
 *      this turn" — it never interrupts the conversation.
 *   4. The instruction below hands the model an EMPTY skeleton as the shape to
 *      copy, so a model that copies it verbatim is a normal turn, not an
 *      anomaly. Empty text therefore means "not touching this field", never
 *      "blank it" — losing the user's instructions is unrecoverable, and the
 *      panel holds no backup of what was there.

const INSTRUCTION = `You are acting as the NarraNexus Agent Builder for this conversation.
Help the user design ONE practical agent. Reply in the user's language.

Prefer producing a reasonable draft immediately over interrogating the user.
Ask at most two focused questions per turn, and only questions that materially
change behaviour. When the request is already complete, ask nothing.

Every reply MUST end with exactly one block, and nothing after it:
${DRAFT_OPEN}{"name":"","description":"","awareness":"","skill_ids":[],"channels":[]}${DRAFT_CLOSE}

Rules for that block:
- Valid, compact JSON on ONE physical line. No Markdown fences around it.
- Escape every line break inside a string as \\n. NEVER emit a literal
  newline inside a JSON string.
- Preserve good existing values from CURRENT CONFIG unless the user asks for a
  change. The user edits the panel directly, so CURRENT CONFIG is the truth —
  revise it, do not overwrite it.
- name is concise and suitable for a sidebar list.
- description is ONE sentence, at most 200 characters. It is read by OTHER
  AGENTS deciding whether to route work here, not by humans.
- awareness is the agent's future instructions, in Markdown: role, workflow,
  output, constraints. Write instructions, not a report about them.
- skill_ids may only contain ids listed in AVAILABLE SKILLS.
- channels may only contain values from SUPPORTED CHANNELS, and states intent
  only — the user supplies every credential themselves.
- Never request, expose, or place secrets, tokens, passwords, or environment
  variable values anywhere in the block.

The interface applies the block to the agent and shows the result in the
configuration panel. Do not claim you changed anything the panel does not
show, and do not paste the block's contents into your prose.`;

 * copied skeleton must be a no-op turn rather than a wipe of name,
 * description and instructions at once. Each field is judged on its own —

 *
 * name and description are additionally cut to the server's column width. A

 * merely verbose, so cutting keeps the intent where falling back would make
 * the user feel ignored. Cutting here, not at write time, keeps `next` equal
 * to what gets written — otherwise every later diff would see a change and
 * re-send the same 422 forever. awareness is long text and is not cut.
 *
 * skill_ids: `null` for the catalogue means "the catalogue is not known yet"
 * (the fetch failed or has not landed), and the proposed ids are left alone
 * as the current recommendations rather than filtered to nothing — a catalogue
 * that IS known and simply does not list an id still rejects it. channels are
