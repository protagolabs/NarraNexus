 * @description: The two no-reply turn markers and their render-time labels.
 *
 * A turn that produced no owner-facing reply is persisted by the backend
 * chat module (`plugins/builtin.chat/src/narranexus_plugins/chat_module/
 * chat_module.py`, persist_turn) with one of two fixed English
 * markers as its assistant content: the user stopped the turn, or the agent
 * chose silence. The live session (chatStore.stopStreaming) writes the SAME
 * marker, so a settled bubble and its reloaded history row carry identical
 * content, and literal comparisons (buildTimeline's non-chat junk filter,
 * the backend's is_no_response check) keep working. Only the renderer
 * turns a marker into a localized label; the marker itself never changes
 * with the UI language.
