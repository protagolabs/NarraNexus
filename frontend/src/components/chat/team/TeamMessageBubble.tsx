 * @description: One message in a team room, rendered so a six-way conversation
 * can be read.
 *
 * Extracted from TeamChatPanel (876 lines) because this batch changes exactly
 * this: how one message looks. Only what this batch touches has been pulled
 * out — a wholesale reorganisation would be easier to review as its own change
 * and harder to review mixed with behaviour.
 *
 * Four things this fixes, each a way the room was unreadable or untruthful:
 *
 * **Identity.** Every agent shared one silicon colour and one avatar style; the
 * only difference between two speakers was 10px of grey text, which mobile
 * hides. Six agents were a uniform grey waterfall. The colour comes from
 * `senderIdentity`, seeded on the AGENT ID, so it is the same colour this agent
 * has in the inbox and the dashboard — an identity, not a decoration.
 *
 * **Length.** A long report ate the screen. Collapsed by default above a
 * threshold, matching the inbox's existing behaviour.
 *
 * **Deliberation vs answer.** With `include_monologue` on (team turns only) the
 * agent's thinking and its reply were concatenated into one markdown blob. They
 * are now laid out apart — but ONLY when the server recorded the boundary. A
 * message without segments renders as one block, which is what it did before:
 * guessing where the split was is worse than showing none, because a wrong
 * guess presents deliberation as a conclusion.
 *
 * **Mentions.** Being @mentioned was invisible in the body, so the person
 * addressed had to read every message to discover it was them. Only real
 * members (and @all) light up: highlighting anything after an @ would catch
 * email addresses and teach the reader to ignore the highlight.
