/**
 * @file_name: TeamTranscript.tsx
 * @author: NarraNexus

 * @description: The team room's message stream.
 *
 * Exists as its own component because "when did this happen" is a property of
 * the SEQUENCE, not of any one message — a bubble cannot know whether it is the
 * first of a new day. That is also the single thing this adds over the loop it
 * replaces.
 *
 * A team room is an ASYNC space: the user hands it work and comes back later.
 * Without separators, Monday's message sits flush against Thursday's and reads
 * as one conversation. The private chat has had them for a long time; the room
 * is where they matter more, not less.
 *
 * Days are cut in LOCAL time. Two instants can share a UTC date and fall on
 * different days for the reader, and the separator's only job is to agree with
 * the clock on their wall.
 *
 * System lines (a stop notice, a bulletin change, a patrol sweep) are the room
 * speaking, not a member: they are handed back to the caller to render as
 * centred notices rather than given an identity and a bubble. They still open a
 * day, or a day whose only event was one of them would look like part of the
 * previous one.
