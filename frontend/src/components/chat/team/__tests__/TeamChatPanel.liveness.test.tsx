/**
 * @file_name: TeamChatPanel.liveness.test.tsx
 * @description: The transcript shows a sign of life, not only a running turn.
 *
 * PRD "Team chat responsiveness" is about the room going visibly dead
 * after someone speaks. The backend has known better all along: the team GET
 * reports four states, and `queued` is computed straight from pending messages,
 * so it is true within one 3s poll of the message landing — it does not wait
 * for the trigger to pick the agent up.
 *
 * The transcript did not use it. It rendered a bubble only for `running`, which
 * a member reaches after the poll interval, a worker slot and Step 0. Between
 * those two moments the roster on the right knew someone was up, and the
 * conversation on the left showed nothing. That gap IS the reported symptom.
 *
 * This does not contradict the rule the two-pane layout was built on (see
 * TeamChatPanel.roster.test.tsx): a FINISHED turn still leaves nothing behind.
 * The rule is that `idle` leaves no trace — not that only `running` may show
 * one. `queued` and `stalled` are both live states with a message in flight.
 *
 * Deliberately reuses the roster's existing vocabulary
 * (`chat.team.activity.queued` / `.stalled` / `.waitingFor` / `.silentFor`)
 * rather than inventing transcript-only strings: two surfaces describing the
 * same state with different words is its own confusion, and it would have meant
 * new keys in ten locale files for no gain.
