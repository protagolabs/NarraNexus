/**
 * @file_name: mergeTeamMessages.test.ts
 * @description: Folding an incremental poll into what is already on screen.
 *
 * The room re-fetched all 200 messages every 3 seconds. The `since` parameter
 * has existed end to end for a long time — the frontend simply never sent it.
 *
 * What made the full refetch safe was not care, it was `setMessages(all)`:
 * replacing the array wholesale is idempotent by construction, so nothing could
 * duplicate or go stale. Incremental merging has to earn that property back,
 * and these tests are where it is earned.
 *
 * The merge is append-only-with-dedup rather than a general reconciliation
 * because `bus_messages` has no UPDATE path anywhere in the codebase — a
 * message is written once and never edited. A merge that tried to reconcile
 * edits would be solving a problem the data model does not have, while adding
 * one it does not need. If that ever changes, the last test here is the one
 * that should start failing.
