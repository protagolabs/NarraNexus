/**
 * @file_name: TeamChatPanel.renderCost.test.tsx
 * @description: The transcript does not re-parse itself every second.
 *
 * `Markdown` is memo'd because remark/rehype re-parse the entire body on every
 * render, and this panel renders at least once a second (a 1s ticker keeps live
 * durations moving) and once per keystroke (the composer's text lives here).
 *
 * That memo is shallow, so it holds only while its props keep their identity —
 * and the chain that feeds it is three components long: the panel's
 * `memberNames` → each bubble's `nameSet` → each bubble's rehype plugin array.
 * One inline `Object.fromEntries(...)` at the top defeats all of it, and the
 * symptom is not a failure: the room simply gets heavier the longer it is open,
 * and typing drops frames in a busy room. Nobody would suspect mention
 * highlighting.
 *
 * So the invariant is tested where it can actually be observed — at the prop
 * itself. Counting re-parses would mean reaching into ReactMarkdown; asserting
 * the identity is stable across a re-render is the same statement, one level up
 * and without the coupling.
