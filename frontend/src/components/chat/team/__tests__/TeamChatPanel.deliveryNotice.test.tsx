/**
 * @file_name: TeamChatPanel.deliveryNotice.test.tsx
 * @description: The room says when a turn delivered nothing.
 *
 * Backend counterpart: message_bus/delivery_notice.py. Two new platform lines
 * reach the transcript — `system_undelivered` (the turn produced nothing) and
 * `system_delivery_failed` (the reply existed, posting it failed). Both must
 * render as ROOM-level lines: dressing either as the agent's own bubble would
 * put words in its mouth, and the second one would attribute OUR write failure
 * to the agent.
 *
 * The English `content` is a fallback for text-only consumers (logs, exports),
 * never the thing a reader sees — the database cannot know their language. So
 * these tests also pin that the raw sentence does NOT reach the transcript.
