/**
 * @file_name: TeamChatPanel.mobileLayout.test.tsx
 * @description: Regression guard for GitHub #131 — on a phone-width viewport
 * the send button was clipped off-screen because the room's own flex column
 * had no `min-w-0`. MainLayout's ancestor wraps this panel in
 * `overflow-hidden`, so once a flex item is allowed to grow past the
 * viewport (the browser's default flex auto-min-size lets non-wrapping
 * descendants do that), the excess is clipped rather than scrolled — the
 * right-anchored send button ends up outside the visible area.
 *
 * jsdom has no layout engine, so this cannot assert the button's actual
 * on-screen position; it pins the CSS contract instead (`min-w-0` on the
 * room's flex column) so a revert of the fix goes red.
