/**
 * @file_name: TeamChatPanel.roster.test.tsx
 * @description: The two-pane team room's contract.
 *
 * Two decisions are pinned here, both learned from the folded console this
 * layout replaces:
 *   1. "who is in this room and what are they doing" is STANDING chrome — the
 *      roster lists every member without anyone expanding anything
 *   2. the transcript only ever carries a typing bubble for a member working
 *      RIGHT NOW; a finished turn leaves nothing behind, because its trace now
 *      lives one click away in the roster instead of piling up in the flow
 * plus the wiring between them: clicking a typing bubble opens that member's
 * process in the roster (one selection, two surfaces).
