/**
 * @file_name: TeamChatPanel.history.test.tsx
 * @description: Reaching the part of the conversation that scrolled off.
 *
 * The room fetched `limit=200` with no cursor, and the bus's `get_messages` is
 * `ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT n` — the OLDEST 200. A room that had said more
 * than that opened on its first day, and since every later poll walked FORWARD
 * from what was on screen, it stayed there. Nothing looked broken; the room
 * just showed the wrong end of itself, permanently.
 *
 * So this is two things at once: the room now opens on the newest page (server
 * side, pinned in tests/backend/test_team_chat_paging.py), and the older pages
 * need a way back. Reaching the top asks for the page above.
 *
 * The awkward part is scroll position. Prepending content moves everything the
 * reader is looking at down by exactly the height of what was added — so the
 * naive version teleports them away from the message they were reading, which
 * is the one thing a "load more" must not do.
