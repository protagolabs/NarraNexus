/**
 * @file_name: TeamMemberPanel.phases.test.tsx
 * @description: The team member panel settles the run-agent (3.4) phase row
 * from the SAME shared rule ProcessPanel uses — fed the UNFILTERED
 * observation.steps, not the whitelisted `phases`.
 *
 * Why this test exists: the panel renders only the whitelisted phases
 * (PHASE_STEP_IDS), but "a later phase started" is how the run-agent row
 * settles via a housekeeping id (4/5) that the whitelist drops. If the caller
 * passed the filtered `phases` to phaseSettled, `phases.some(> 3.4)` is always
 * false and the 3.4 row spins forever whenever the loop-end COMPLETED is
 * missed (error path / early return). This pins that it passes the full list —
 * symmetric to ProcessPanel.test's phase-row coverage.
