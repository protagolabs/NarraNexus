 * @description: Folding an incremental poll into the transcript already on
 * screen.
 *
 * The room re-fetched all 200 messages every 3 seconds. `since` has existed end
 * to end for a long time; the frontend simply never sent it.
 *
 * What made the full refetch correct was not care — it was `setMessages(all)`.
 * Replacing the array wholesale is idempotent by construction, so nothing could
 * duplicate or go stale. Merging incrementally has to earn that property back,
 * which is what this module is for.
 *
 * **Append-only with dedup, not reconciliation.** `bus_messages` has no UPDATE
 * path anywhere in the codebase: a message is written once and never edited. A
 * merge that tried to reconcile edits would solve a problem the data model does
 * not have while adding one it does not need. That assumption is load-bearing,
 * so it is stated here rather than left implicit — if messages ever become
 * mutable, this is the file that has to change first.
 *
 * **Identity is preserved when nothing changed.** React re-renders on identity,
 * and a poll that returned a fresh array every three seconds would re-render
 * the whole transcript twenty times a minute for nothing — resetting any
 * expander the reader had opened along the way.

 * backwards after an out-of-order insert — refetching — or forwards past

 *
 * Undefined for an empty transcript, so the first poll is an unambiguous full
 * load rather than a `since=` the server has to interpret.
