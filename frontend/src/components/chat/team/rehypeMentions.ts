 * @description: Highlighting @mentions without touching code.
 *
 * An agent @mentioning a teammate IS the handoff, so the addressee has to be
 * able to spot it without reading every message. The first version did that by
 * rewriting the markdown SOURCE — a `String.replace` over the whole body before
 * it was parsed.
 *
 * That put a literal `<span data-testid="mention-all" class="…">@all</span>`
 * inside every code block containing `@all`, `@everyone` or a teammate's name —
 * and a team room's main output is code and commands, where `@all` is a real
 * make target, a shell argument, and another IM's mention syntax. Markdown
 * escapes HTML inside a fence, so it was never a security problem; it was worse
 * in a mundane way: what the user copied out of the room was broken, and the
 * first suspicion would fall on the model rather than on the renderer.
 *
 * A regex cannot know what a code block is. The AST does, so the replacement
 * happens there — and code is excluded by NOT DESCENDING into it, rather than by
 * asking each text node who its parent is. The two answers differ as soon as
 * anything sits in between, which raw HTML (`rehypeRaw` is on) and any token
 * highlighter both do.
 *
 * The pattern lives in `mentionPattern`, shared with the plain-text renderer for
 * the user's own messages. It must also stay identical to the server's
 * `_extract_team_mentions` and the composer's autocomplete — highlighting
 * someone who will not actually be woken (or missing someone who will) is worse
 * than not highlighting at all.
