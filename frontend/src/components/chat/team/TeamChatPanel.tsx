 * @description: Team group-chat surface. Renders one team's shared room:
 * a member bar on top (the user + member agents), then two panes — the message
 * timeline plus composer on the left, the standing member roster on the right.
 * The user posts into the room and @-mentioned agents reply; mentioning @all
 * addresses everyone.
 *
 * Wiring: messages flow over the message bus. Send → POST
 * /api/teams/{id}/chat/messages (sender = usr_<user_id>, mentions = agent_ids
 * and/or "@all"); the standalone MessageBusTrigger runs the @mentioned agents
 * and posts their replies back into the room. The panel polls
 * GET /api/teams/{id}/chat/messages for the live transcript.

 * highlight = same accent on both sides), so the transcript stays a transcript
 * and every number lives in exactly one place.
 *
 * Renders for three live states, not just `running`:
 *
 *   running  animated dots, "is typing" — unchanged
 *   queued   still dots, dimmed, plus how long it has been waiting
 *   stalled  plus how long there has been no signal
 *
 * Why `queued` belongs here at all: it is derived from pending messages on the
 * GET, so it is true within one 3s poll of the message landing — it does not
 * wait for the poll interval, a worker slot and Step 0 the way `running` does.
 * Showing only `running` is what left the conversation blank while the roster
 * already knew someone was up, which is the "dead room" the PRD is about.
 *
 * `idle` still renders nothing: a FINISHED turn leaves no trace in the flow,
 * its record lives one click away in the roster. That rule is unchanged — it
 * was never "only running may show", it was "finished leaves nothing".
 *
 * Colour and copy both come from `STATUS_TONES` — this is the FOURTH surface
 * rendering these states, and `teamActivity.ts` exists precisely so they cannot
 * disagree about what "stalled" looks like. Hard-coding them here (the first
 * version did) put `stalled` at warning-amber in the transcript while the
 * roster drew it error-red for the same member at the same moment: two
 * different severities, one state. Softening is applied ON TOP of the semantic
 * colour (see `opacity` below), never by swapping it for another one.

                    Was `status === 'running'`, which is a state a member only
                    reaches after the poll interval, a worker slot and Step 0.
                    `queued` is true within one 3s poll of the message landing,
                    so widening the filter is what closes the window where the
                    roster knew somebody was up and the conversation looked
                    dead — the "dead room" the PRD is named after. */}
