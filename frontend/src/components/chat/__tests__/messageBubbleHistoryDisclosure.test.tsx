/**
 * A historical turn's process must land in the SAME document shape as a live
 * one — and getting there must not be a one-way door.
 *
 * The bug this pins (reported 2026-08-31): clicking "view reasoning" fetched
 * the event log, which made `segmentsForRender` non-null, which unmounted the
 * very block the button lived in. The button vanished mid-interaction with no
 * way back, and on the branch where segments did NOT materialise the process
 * arrived with its reasoning still folded — a second click demanded right
 * after the first one was spent.
