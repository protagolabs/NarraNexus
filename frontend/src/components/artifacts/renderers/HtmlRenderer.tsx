/**
 * @file_name: HtmlRenderer.tsx
 * @description: Security-hardened renderer for text/html artifacts.
 *
 * Renders agent-emitted HTML inside an isolated iframe. Supports
 * multi-file artifacts: the entry HTML may reference sibling assets in its
 * own folder (./style.css, ./app.js, ./data.json, images) — they are served
 * from the same token-protected directory URL the iframe `src` points at.
 *
 * Security contract (must NOT be relaxed without a spec change):
 *   sandbox = "allow-scripts"        — inline JS may run
 *   ✗ allow-same-origin              — iframe is opaque-origin; cannot read parent DOM or cookies
 *   ✗ allow-top-navigation           — cannot break out / redirect the top frame
 *   ✗ allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox — cannot spawn an unsandboxed window
 *   referrerPolicy = no-referrer     — no origin leak to any external destination
 *
 * Why allow-scripts but no allow-same-origin?
 *   With allow-same-origin the iframe shares the parent origin and can read
 *   parent localStorage, cookies, and DOM — a trivial XSS escape. Without it,
 *   the iframe is opaque-origin and isolated. allow-scripts is needed for
 *   chart libraries and interactive demos.
 *
 * Why iframe `src` (not blob: URL)?
 *   blob: URLs break relative sub-resource resolution (the entry HTML's
 *   `./style.css` would not resolve). The pointer model needs sibling assets
 *   to work, so the iframe loads a real URL. Authentication uses the HMAC
 *   token embedded in the URL path — see `_artifact_token.py` and
 *   `artifacts_public.py` on the backend.
 *
 *   The CSP header on the entry response (built dynamically from the request
 *   origin) restricts sub-resource loading to the same host — external
 *   destinations stay blocked. Combined with the opaque-origin sandbox, this
 *   gives the same isolation guarantees as the previous blob: design while
 *   making multi-file artifacts actually work.
