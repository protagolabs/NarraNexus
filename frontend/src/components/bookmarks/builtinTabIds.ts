 * @description: The shell's own rail tab ids — the one literal list, typed so shell code cannot misspell one.
 *
 * The strip itself is DERIVED from the `PANELS` registry (`tabs.ts`), and a
 * plugin may register any id, so the open type stays `AtomicTabId = string`.
 * What the shell writes by hand — its own registrations in
 * `platform/builtin.ts`, the chat header's fixed menu groups — is typed
 * `BuiltinTabId`, so a typo there is a compile error rather than a
 * silently empty drawer. `builtin.test.ts` pins that the registry's
 * builtin-owned strip tabs are exactly this list.
