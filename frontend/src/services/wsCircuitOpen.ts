/**
 * @file_name: wsCircuitOpen.ts
 * @description: Detect the WebSocket "agent circuit-breaker open" frame so the
 * app can surface a banner with a "Resume" action, symmetric with the
 * auth-expired path (wsAuthError.ts).
 *
 * Background: backend/routes/websocket.py sends a fresh-run rejection frame
 * `{type:'error', error_type:'agent_circuit_open', severity:'fatal',
 * cb_reason:'paused:auth'|'paused:quota'|'cooling'|'probing'}` when the real-time-layer
 * circuit-breaker (agent_framework/loop/circuit_breaker.py) is open for that
 * agent. Without this the user would just see a red chat bubble; the banner
 * gives them a one-click path to re-enable the agent once they've fixed the
 * underlying key/balance.
 *
 * Helper extracted so wsManager's run()/reconnect() handlers share it and the
 * logic is unit-testable without a real WebSocket.
 *
 * GitHub #117 follow-up: the banner used to be purely event-driven — once
 * shown it never re-checked reality, so a self-healed breaker (the backend's
 * half-open probe succeeding, or an owner confirming their key elsewhere)
 * left a stale "paused" banner up until the user manually dismissed or
 * retried. App.tsx now polls GET /api/agents/{id}/circuit-breaker (an
 * existing, already-wired endpoint — see agents_circuit_breaker.py) while
 * the banner is showing a "paused" reason (hooks/useCircuitBannerAutoClear),
 * and `shouldClearCircuitBanner` is the pure decision of whether that fresh
 * status means the banner is stale and should close itself.
