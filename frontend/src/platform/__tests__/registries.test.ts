 * @file_name: registries.test.ts

 * @description: The sixteen registry names are a contract: this file is the hand-written list, and both consumers (host.ts's per-plugin facade, loader.ts's disable sweep) must cover exactly it.
 *
 * Why hand-written: `REGISTRY_NAMES` below is deliberately NOT derived from
 * `REGISTRIES` — a test that reads the same object it is checking passes for
 * any content, including a registry silently deleted along with its slot. The
 * only guard on these names was `plugins/builtin.ui/tests/test_ui_package.py`,
 * which text-parses `registries/index.ts` from Python: it catches a name that
 * drifts from the manifest, but nothing asserted that `HostAPI.registries`
 * exposes all sixteen (`host.test.tsx` only walks `commands`) or that
 * `disableBuiltinUi` sweeps all sixteen. Dropping a registry from the table AND
 * from the manifest together used to be green on both sides.
