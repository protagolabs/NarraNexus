/**
 * @file_name: useAutoRefresh.teams.test.ts
 * @description: The sidebar's team rows are kept fresh in the background.
 *
 * The room-activity mark on a team row is a comparison between a client
 * watermark and a server timestamp that arrives with the TEAM LIST. Nothing
 * refreshed that list on a timer: it was fetched once, when the sidebar found it
 * unloaded. So a room could talk for an hour and the mark would appear only on
 * the next full page reload — a feature indistinguishable, from the user's side,
 * from one that does not work.
 *
 * The second thing pinned here is the guard. The scheduler used to require a
 * selected AGENT before starting at all, which meant a user sitting in a team
 * room could have no background refresh whatsoever. Every poll that needs an
 * agent still checks for one itself.
