@description: Every host process actually boots the plugin platform, and declares itself healthy only once it serves.

Two separate claims, both previously untested:

1. **The five entrypoints call boot.** Deleting ``boot_executor_plugins()`` from
   the executor's lifespan (or the equivalent line in the mcp runner, the
   workers supervisor, the channels supervisor, the backend lifespan) left the
   whole suite green: ``test_turn_loaded_for_every_turn_host`` proves that
   *calling boot* fills the slots, never that the entrypoint calls it. The
   registries would simply be empty in production.
2. **Health is declared after the host serves, not at the end of boot.**
   ``BootReport.mark_healthy`` clears the boot-crash marker AND moves the
   last-known-good snapshot, so firing it inside ``_boot`` meant a process that
   populated its registries and then died before serving still advanced the
   rollback target — the exact state safe mode exists to escape.
