@description: The place our refusals send the user must actually exist.

From a real report (2026-09-22): the agent correctly refused with "install the
browser from Settings → Browser", and there was no Browser section in
Settings. The agent was right and the app was missing the destination — which,
from the user's seat, is indistinguishable from the agent making things up.

A unit test on either side alone could not catch that: the backend's message
was well-formed and the frontend's components all rendered. Only the link
between them was broken, so that link is what gets asserted here.
