@description: The three artifact surfaces, and the leaks between them.

Artifacts gained a team dimension, which splits one list into three with
DIFFERENT answers — and the failure modes point in opposite directions, so
testing only one of them proves nothing:

  private panel   private only          leak = a team's work shows up in a
                                        one-to-one chat
  team panel      that team only        leak = one team sees another's work
  agent prompt    private ∪ its teams   leak = the agent cannot see the work
                                        it is supposed to pick up, and the
                                        hand-off silently stops working

The last one is the reverse leak: an over-narrow query fails closed and looks
harmless, but it breaks the entire point of a shared workspace. Both
directions are asserted below.

Membership is resolved from `team_members`, never from the owning user: one
user owns many teams, so "same user" would hand every team's artifacts to
every agent the user owns.
