@date: 2026-08-18
@description: `get_user_timezone` must always return a USABLE IANA zone.

The bug this guards against is one the codebase already had once: the
docstring promised "returns 'UTC' if user does not exist" while the
implementation returned `user.timezone` verbatim for any user that DID
exist — blank and malformed included. The promise was therefore kept only
by each caller remembering to wrap the result in `resolve_timezone`, and
three of six had not.

Most of those got away with it because something downstream wrapped the
value again. `services/instance_sync_service` did not: it freezes this
value into a Job's `trigger_config` at creation, so a malformed zone is
PERSISTED and re-read on every later schedule computation, where it
reaches `ZoneInfo()` and raises. The symptom is "some jobs stopped
firing", months after whatever wrote the bad row.

Why these tests exist at all, given the current write paths are clean:
`backend/routes/auth.py` validates with `is_valid_timezone`, `add_user`
defaults to "UTC", and the schema default is "UTC" — so a bad value can
only arrive from a historical row, a direct DB edit, or a write path
nobody has added yet. The contract is therefore not currently load-bearing
for any user; it is load-bearing for the NEXT change. Without these
assertions, someone cleaning up the repository layer (or deciding the
`resolve_timezone` wrapper is redundant overhead) reverts one line, CI
stays green, and the persisted-bad-timezone failure comes back.

Verified by mutation: restoring the old `if user: return user.timezone`
leaves every other test in the suite green.

The assertions are exact `"UTC"` literals on purpose. `is_valid_timezone(...)`
would be satisfied by the old implementation too on the cases that matter,
i.e. would test nothing.
