@description: The bulletin's storage rules — the ones the rest of the feature
assumes and therefore cannot re-check.

Three of these encode decisions that are easy to get wrong later and expensive
to notice:

  * the auto-summary is a SLOT, not a growing list. It enters every team turn's
    prompt, so an accumulating summary reproduces the exact problem the
    bulletin exists to solve — and a bad summary would compound instead of
    being overwritten.
  * the summary does not spend the user's entry budget. Automatic output must
    never be able to push a hand-written rule out of the prompt.
  * budget arithmetic counts what actually reaches the prompt, so an over-long
    entry is refused at the edge rather than silently trimmed. A user who is
    told nothing assumes the whole rule is in force.
