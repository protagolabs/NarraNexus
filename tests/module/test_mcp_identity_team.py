@description: The turn's team rides the server-side identity channel.

Why it must be server-side: `register_artifact` takes `agent_id` as a tool
PARAMETER the model fills in, so nothing the tool receives from the model can
be trusted to say "this is a team turn" — a model in a private chat could
claim otherwise and write into a team's workspace. The identity headers exist
precisely because a machine-knowable fact must not depend on model obedience
(see module/_mcp_identity.py), so the team rides there too.

`errand_channel` deliberately is NOT reused for this: it is populated only
when the turn continues the agent's own errand (message_bus_trigger), so it
is empty for most team turns and would read as "not a team turn".

The bearer contract says a new fact is APPENDED and added to BEARER_FIELDS —
these tests pin that it was appended (never inserted), because inserting
mid-record silently reassigns the meaning of every later position.
