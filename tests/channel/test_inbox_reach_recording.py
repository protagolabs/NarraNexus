@description: Reachability is recorded AUTOMATICALLY on an inbound channel turn.

Before this, `contact_info.channels` was populated only if the model remembered
to call `extract_entity_info` (channel prompt instruction #5) — so the address
book was effectively empty, and an agent on another surface had no way to learn
it could reach a contact on Lark/Slack/etc.

`InboxRecorder.record_turn` fires on every inbound channel turn and knows the
channel, the agent, the counterpart, and the conversation id. It now writes
"agent reaches counterpart on <channel> via <chat_id>" onto the counterpart's
social entity — the single home for reach (no parallel per-surface rosters).
Best-effort: it must never break the inbox write.
