@description: The design doc's §6 acceptance cases, as tests.

Three obligations, from the 2026-08-17 ingress design:

  MUST trip     — replay the 8/14 traffic shape (1-2 s apart, byte-identical)
                  and the breaker escalates within minutes, cutting pipeline
                  executions by >95%.
  MUST NOT trip — a user firing off messages, a group at peak, a job batch.
                  Not one of them may be isolated. This is the half that
                  matters: a breaker that trips on real conversation is worse
                  than no breaker, because it silences the product.
  DELETION test — with the guard removed, the replay must run the full
                  pipeline for every message again. If it does not, this file
                  is not testing what it claims to.

The guard is driven directly rather than through a trigger: these are
claims about the POLICY, and routing them through six channels' plumbing
would test the plumbing. Wiring will be covered by
``test_ingress_guard_all_paths``, which lands with the wiring PR.

The DELETION guard named above — the one that fails if the breaker is
switched off — also lands there: it asserts on a trigger class attribute
that does not exist until the guard is mounted. So the MUST-NOT-TRIP
cases below are, in this commit, not yet protected against the breaker
being disabled outright.
