@description: Every inbound path must route through the ingress breaker.

There is no single chokepoint to place the guard in. ``LarkTrigger`` owns
its whole ``_process_message`` and never calls ``super()``; managed mode
bypasses the subscriber path entirely (no ``_subscribe_loop``, no dedup
store, no worker queue). So the seam is the METHOD — ``_ingress_admitted``
— and the invariant "every receive path calls it" is not something the
type system or any unit test can hold.

Same defect class, and the same answer, as
``test_trigger_envelope_every_channel``: ``build_trigger_extra_data`` was
hand-rolled at four sites and the turn envelope was added to one of them,
leaving Lark p2p and NarraMessenger DMs silently unprotected. These tests
pin the seam so the NEXT ingress gate cannot skip a channel — and so that
deleting the guard from Lark (which looks like harmless duplicate code)
fails loudly instead of quietly.
