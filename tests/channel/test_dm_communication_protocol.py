@description: Pins the DM-vs-group split of the IM Communication Protocol.

The shared channel prompt used to inject ONE Communication Protocol into
every channel turn regardless of room type: "Your default action is NO
REPLY", "When to Stay Silent (most of the time)", "When to Reply (rare)",
plus group-chat and @mention discipline. That rule set was tuned in
2026-03 for three GROUP problems (agent-to-agent ack loops, every group
message waking every member, @mention abuse) — applying it to a 1:1 DM
from a real person made silence the correct behaviour, which is the
0802 WeChat report: a person sends "hello" and the agent answers nothing.

WeChat is the extreme case: its context builder hard-codes room_type to
"Direct Message" (personal-account v1 is DM-only), so 100% of its turns
were being told not to reply.
