@description: `send_message_to_user_directly` became two names — the accounting
must recognise both, on the surfaces that use them.

The split (decision: 2026-08-17) exists because the one tool carried two
OPPOSITE disciplines: answering your owner is expected on almost every chat
turn, notifying your owner from someone else's conversation is something you do
only for (a)/(b)/(c). Each name now carries its own.

The hazard the split introduces is here: `_has_organic_reply` asks the registry
"did this turn speak?", and a registry that knows only one of the two names goes
blind on the surface that uses the other. On the owner's chat turn that means a
perfectly answered turn reads as "never spoke", and the helper-LLM fallback
writes a SECOND reply on top of it — every time.

    """Repo-wide, and it distinguishes prose from a functional identifier.

    `send_message_to_user_directly` is legitimately named in HISTORY — a dozen
    comments and docstrings explain what it was and why it split, and rewriting
    those would destroy the record. What must not exist is the name in a
    FUNCTIONAL position, because 铁律 #2 leaves no shim: nothing answers to it.

    Round 3 of this PR's pre-review found four such sites, all in `scripts/`, and
    the worst was `nexus_power_vs_claude_bench.py`'s `REPLY_TOOLS` — the harness
    that validates the expressive-surface contract THIS change rewrites. It would
    have recorded zero replies for every run and reported NexusPower as silent:
    a measuring instrument lying in the direction that hides a regression in the
    mechanism it measures.

    The distinction is drawn with AST rather than by grepping for `#`: a comment
    is invisible to the parser, and a docstring is the one string constant that is
    prose by construction. Every OTHER string constant, and any identifier, is
    functional. That is exactly where the four sites lived.
