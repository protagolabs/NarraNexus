@description: Binding rule #16 gate — a suppressed message leaves a row.

Once the breaker is wired, a message judged part of a storm is dropped and
the far side sees nothing: the assistant simply stops answering. That is
the 0802 symptom, and the 8/14 incident ran 70+ hours precisely because
"the bot went quiet" was not answerable from any durable record — the logs
had rotated and there was nothing in the DB to count.

So the rule for this path is: every drop writes a row, per message, and the
row carries enough to answer "why, and until when". The managed surface has
the same gate in `tests/backend/test_manyfold_im_ingress.py`; this file
covers the native one, which audits through a different call site — a fact
that only surfaced because a mutation removing the native audit left the
managed tests green.
