@description: The recorder against a real database — repeat-safety and the
guards that survived the move off the bus tables.

Replaces `test_channel_inbox_writer.py`. Most of what that file pinned is now
in `test_inbox_recorder.py` (fake-db, faster): the thread is created once, a
placeholder name is refreshed, a silent turn writes one row, thread ids carry
their family prefix. Two guards had no home in that file and are relocated
here rather than dropped:

  * repeat-write safety — the old writer's "get, then insert only when
    missing" shape is easy to lose in a refactor and the symptom (a duplicated
    thread per inbound message) is only visible against a real DB;
  * the constructor's rejection of an empty source.

Deliberately NOT carried over: assertions about `bus_agent_registry`,
`bus_channels` and `bus_channel_members` rows. Those rows are the thing this
change removes — `test_inbox_recorder.py::test_the_recorder_never_writes_a_bus_table`
is now the guard that they stay gone.

    layer up: the managed path passed `(reply_text or "").strip() or
    CHANNEL_SILENT_SENTINEL`, so silence arrived as a non-empty string and the
    recorder dutifully wrote `(stayed silent)` as an OUTBOUND row attributed to
    the agent — while the other call site, three hundred lines away, passed the
    text as-is. Telegram and WeChat read `inbox_thread_messages` as their
    conversation memory, so that string came back to the agent as its own
    previous reply; `_platform_reply_text`'s own docstring names this failure.
