@description: "Is the far side another agent?" — one definition, filled
everywhere, reaching the model.

The DM Communication Protocol's "Breaking a Loop" section leans on knowing
whether the other party is a machine, and until now the platform had no
way to say so: the model could only guess from how the messages read.

This pins three things, because the signal is worthless if any one of them
is missing:
  1. the seam answers (per channel, one definition)
  2. every ChannelTag construction site fills it
  3. the tag actually renders it, so the model sees it

Point 2 is the fragile one. ``build_trigger_extra_data`` was once
hand-rolled at four sites and a new key was added to exactly one of them —
the same shape as the tag sites here.

Editing history worth knowing: this file was once edited by truncating it
at a marker string, which silently deleted seven tests — including the one
linking the prompt literal to ``AGENT_PEER_MARKER``. The suite stayed green
because the survivors still passed. **Green is not "complete"**; when
editing this file, diff the set of test names before and after.
