@description: The one line that tells the agent where a turn came from
(design §6.1) is rendered from the registry, never phrased twice.

What these tests defend is not the wording — it is the property that made the
wording safe to write once: the label and the reply tool come from data the
platform already computed for other purposes (`MessageSourceRegistry`, and the
turn's `get_expressive_tools` output). Nothing here re-derives either, so the
sentence cannot end up describing a desk the agent does not have.

The prose this replaced said the same thing in each trigger's own words, and
those copies drifted — a channel prompt still naming a tool the desk no longer
carried gave the agent two instructions and no tiebreak.
