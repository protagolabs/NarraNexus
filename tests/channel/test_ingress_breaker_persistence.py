@description: A cooldown must outlive the process that set it.

The credential breaker in ``channel_trigger_base`` is deliberately
memory-only — it describes LIVE subscriber state, and a stopped trigger
must not carry isolation into its next start. The ingress breaker made
the opposite call, for one reason: the 8/14 loop ran 70+ HOURS. Any
redeploy inside that window would have handed a sender we had already
isolated for a day a completely fresh budget, and the incident would have
resumed with the platform believing it had never seen them.

Split of concerns pinned here:
  - sliding-window counts + fingerprints → memory only (they expire in
    ten minutes; a row per inbound message is pure write amplification)
  - tier + cooldown → written through on TRANSITION, read back on the
    first message a new process sees for that key
