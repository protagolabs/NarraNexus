@description: The inbox record must not touch the bus, and a turn must stay
inbound-then-reply.

`ChannelInboxWriter` wrote its five-row bundle into the MessageBus tables and,
in doing so, put every IM message on the agent's bus unread cursor. The
recorder replaces it. Two properties carry the whole point:

  * it writes ONLY `inbox_*` tables — the containment is structural, not a
    prefix filter (a filter is what drifted in the 2026-07-03 incident);
  * a turn's two rows keep the one-microsecond stagger that orders them.
