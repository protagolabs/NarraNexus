@description: "Never ran yet" must not be spelled 0.0 against a monotonic clock.

`time.monotonic()` counts from BOOT on Linux, so a `_last_*_monotonic = 0.0`
sentinel does not mean "never ran" — it means "ran at boot". Every gate of the
form `monotonic() - mark >= interval` therefore stays silently shut until the
HOST has been up longer than the interval:

  * channel-trigger heartbeat (600s) — no L2 liveness row for the first ten
    minutes of a freshly booted host, which is exactly the window where a
    failing start is most likely and exactly what incident lesson #4 wants
    those beats to cover.
  * channel-trigger retention sweep (24h) — `_run_cleanup` documents itself as
    "once at startup + daily"; a new EC2 instance got neither until its uptime
    reached a day.
  * `ServiceAuditor.heartbeat` (60s) — same shape, small window.

None of this is visible on a developer laptop or a long-lived EC2, where uptime
is measured in weeks: the gate always looks open. It surfaced from the other
end — `test_credential_breaker.py::test_heartbeat_carries_isolation_counts`
used the same `0.0` idiom and passed everywhere except on a fresh CI runner,
where it indexed an empty list (2026-08-17). The test was one instance; the
three production marks were the same assumption.

**These tests drive the gates rather than reading the source.** An earlier draft
asserted `'= float("-inf")' in inspect.getsource(...)`, which fails on a
semantically identical rewrite (extract the sentinel to a constant and it goes
red for nothing) and — worse — stays GREEN if somebody changes the gate itself
to seed semantics (`if mark == -inf: mark = now`), which is the one edit the
mirror doc explicitly warns against. It also claimed a behaviour test needed "a
live queue, workers and an audit repo"; `_maybe_heartbeat` needs only the audit
repo, and `test_credential_breaker.py` had been doing exactly this for a whole
test in the same directory.

The interval is made enormous instead of faking the clock. `-inf` clears any
finite interval; a `0.0` mark cannot clear 1e12 seconds on any real host. That
keeps the discriminating power and drops a fixture that moved `time.monotonic`
BACKWARDS process-wide — harmless only for as long as nobody adds an `await
asyncio.sleep(...)` here, since `loop.time()` IS `time.monotonic()` and a
rewound clock makes timers hang instead of fire.
