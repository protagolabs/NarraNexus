@description: The inbox's own tables — the record layer, decoupled from the bus.

The inbox used to live in `bus_messages` / `bus_channel_members`. Two costs,
both measured on prod 2026-08-17:

  * 86% of `bus_messages` (28,605 of 33,164 rows) was IM inbox content, not bus
    traffic. The table's name described its minority.
  * The writer created a `bus_channel_members` row per agent, and nothing ever
    advanced its `last_read_at` — 159 of 172 IM memberships (92%) had a NULL
    cursor. That made 1,364 IM messages permanently "unread" on the bus, which
    injected them into 90 agents' turn context as if a peer had written them.

So the inbox gets its own tables and the agent's unread injection cannot reach
them — not by a filter, but because the rows are not in the table it reads.
