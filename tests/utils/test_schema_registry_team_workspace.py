@description: Schema guards for the team shared working-space.

Three registrations, one theme — "the team" finally exists in the data
model instead of only on disk:

1. ``instance_artifacts.team_id`` — artifacts gain the team dimension they
   never had (the table was agent_id/user_id only, which is why a team turn's
   artifact could only ever land in one agent's private list).
2. ``team_files`` — the team shared folder had files on disk and no rows in
   the database, so nothing could enumerate it.
3. ``instance_artifact_history`` — attribution for "who changed this, when",
   which is unanswerable today because re-registering overwrites the pointer
   in place.

Every change is additive (iron rule #6): a nullable column and two new
tables, so ``auto_migrate`` provisions them without touching existing rows,
and ``team_id IS NULL`` keeps the exact pre-existing private semantics.
