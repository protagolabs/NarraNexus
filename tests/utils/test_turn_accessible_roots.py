@description: What a turn may reach outside its own workspace.

The first version of this grant handed every turn the whole per-user
`_shared` tree — every team the owner has, on every turn, including one-to-one
chats that belong to no team. That contradicted the rest of the same change:
`_resolve_entry` deliberately admits only the ONE team the turn belongs to,
and `list_for_agent_context` deliberately joins `team_members` rather than
keying on the owner, with a comment saying an owner-keyed check is the
cross-team leak. The confinement layer was using precisely that owner key.

It also is not read-only. `_PATH_ARG_NAMES` covers `file_path`, so the same
grant governs Write/Edit, and `ShellConfinementLayer` governs shell paths —
hence "accessible", not "readable".

`bus_files` stays user-wide on purpose and is not the same kind of grant: the
bus stages an attachment ONCE into the owner's shared area and every same-user
recipient reads that one path. That is the delivery mechanism, not a team
boundary.
