@description: Ambient event attribution for cost rows.

Only step_4 (call_type="agent_loop") ever passed a real event_id; every
helper call site hard-coded event_id=None, so a per-turn token figure
counted the main loop and silently dropped narrative selection, the
shutter/decider, summarisation and post-turn hooks. The fix is an ambient
ContextVar that record_cost falls back to, mirroring how (agent_id, db)
already travel — these tests pin the fallback, the explicit-wins rule, the
scope restore, and the task-copy propagation that background Steps 5-6
depend on.
