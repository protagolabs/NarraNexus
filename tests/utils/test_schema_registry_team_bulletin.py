@description: Schema guards for the team bulletin.

The bulletin fills the gap the PRD names: team-level state that is persistent
AND shared AND loaded every turn. The data layer had the first two available
separately (`teams.description`/`intro_md` are persistent and shared but never
reach a prompt) and the third only in per-agent memory, which is not shared.

Additive only (iron rule #6): one new table, so `auto_migrate` provisions it
without touching any existing row.

The column shape carries two decisions worth guarding, both of which are cheap
to check here and expensive to discover later:

  * `source` and `author_id` are SEPARATE — one drives permissions and budget,
    the other drives display. Merged, a permission check would parse a prefix.
  * `author_id` is NULLABLE — the auto-summary has a source but no author.
    A NOT NULL here would force a sentinel like "system", which then has to be
    excluded by string comparison everywhere a real author is expected.
