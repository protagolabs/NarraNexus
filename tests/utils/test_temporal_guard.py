@description: Lock the diagnostic date-claim scanner.

Two halves matter here and they pull in opposite directions:

  * it has to catch the real thing — an agent stating the wrong date for
    "today", in either language;
  * it has to stay quiet otherwise, because a probe that cries wolf gets
    muted, and a muted probe reads as coverage while providing none.

So the false-positive tests below are not padding. They are the half of the
contract that decides whether anyone will still trust this signal in three
months.
