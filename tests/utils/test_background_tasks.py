@description: `spawn()` — the two halves of incident lesson #2, pinned.

A bare ``asyncio.create_task(coro)`` is a mine twice over:

1. The event loop holds only a WEAK reference (``asyncio.all_tasks``), so a
   task suspended on an await can be collected mid-flight and simply never
   finish — silently, with no traceback.
2. An exception raised inside it surfaces only as a "Task exception was never
   retrieved" warning whenever GC gets around to it.

What these tests can and cannot prove: forcing the collector to actually take a
suspended Task is not portably reproducible (the Event holds the future, which
holds the task's ``__wakeup``), so no test here demonstrates a real collection.
What they DO pin is that a task with no caller-side reference stays tracked,
runs to completion, and reports its exception — which is the property the strong
set exists to provide. Removing ``_TASKS.add`` fails four of the six.
