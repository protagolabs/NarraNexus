@description: The wake signal's table — one row, two dialects.

`MessageBusTrigger._wake` is an in-process `asyncio.Event`, so it cannot reach the
MCP server — and a team reply is a tool call made there. Without a signal the poll
loop sees the message on its next tick (3-12s), which is dead air a person in the
room perceives, i.e. exactly what iron rule #16 forbids.

Pinned here rather than left to the code: the table is what makes the mechanism
work on BOTH backends, and a column declared for only one dialect is the shape of
bug the dual-dialect contract exists to prevent — it would pass every local
SQLite test and fail on the cloud, where production runs.
