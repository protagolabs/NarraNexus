@description: Lock the contract of the agent-facing time renderers.

Symptom this guards against: an agent, asked for "today's meetings",
returned three meetings — but two were actually yesterday. The agent saw
times like 22:07 while it was currently 17:45 and rationalized the
mismatch as "server relative time" instead of catching it. Root cause on
the prompt side: current_time was `datetime.now().isoformat()` → naive,
no timezone, no weekday, potentially in server's local clock instead of
the user's. The agent had no reliable anchor to sanity-check against.

New contract:
  - Resolved in the user's timezone (IANA string)
  - Explicit UTC offset included (e.g. "+08:00")
  - Weekday label for extra human anchor
  - Invalid/missing tz falls back to UTC with a clean "UTC" label
    (never echoes the invalid tz string back as a label)

2026-08-18: the renderer moved out of BasicInfoModule into
`utils/timezone` (three consumers now need identical bytes), and
`format_timestamp_for_agent` joined it — the STORED-timestamp renderer
whose missing offset let a UTC-stored chat history be read as if it
were the user's local wall clock.
