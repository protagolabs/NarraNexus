@description: Regression tests for the 2026-08-17 prod outage — every backend
query failing with `pymysql.err.InterfaceError: (0, 'Not connected')` for 19
minutes while RDS itself was healthy, recoverable only by restarting the
container.

Two defects combined:

1. The open transaction's connection lived in an *instance* attribute. One
   `MySQLBackend` serves the whole event loop, so while any caller sat inside
   `transaction()`, every other concurrent caller's statement was routed onto
   that same connection. Two coroutines reading one socket produced
   "readexactly() called while another coroutine is already waiting for
   incoming data" and desynced the MySQL protocol stream.

2. `commit()` cleared the attribute only *after* a successful COMMIT. Once the
   connection died, the attribute kept pointing at it, so every later statement
   in the process was routed onto a dead socket — permanently, with no path
   back except a restart.

The tests below drive the real `MySQLBackend` / `AsyncDatabaseClient` against a
fake pool, so they exercise the actual branch selection rather than a
reimplementation of it.
