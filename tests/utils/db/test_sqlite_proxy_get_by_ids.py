@date: 2026-08-07
@description: The proxy backend must accept and FORWARD every `get_by_ids`
argument the client can send.

Why this file exists
====================
`AsyncDatabaseClient.get_by_ids` forwards its arguments to whichever backend
`db_factory` selected, so a parameter added to only some of the three
implementations is a `TypeError` on **every** call through the others — the
default value does not save you, because it is still passed by keyword.

That shipped: `fields` was added to the MySQL and SQLite backends and to the
client's delegation, but not to the proxy backend. Cloud (MySQL) stayed green
while `run.sh` and the desktop DMG — both of which set `SQLITE_PROXY_URL` and
therefore route through the proxy — broke on every `get_by_ids`, i.e. every
`BaseRepository` batch load, the inbox, the teams page and chat-context
assembly. Binding rule #7 in one sentence: change one run mode, check the other.

The existing proxy test file covers transactions only, so nothing caught it.
Two tests here, and they must stay a pair:

- `test_accepts_fields` fails on the TypeError (the crash)
- `test_forwards_fields` fails if the argument is accepted but dropped at the
  HTTP boundary (the silent downgrade to `SELECT *`, which saves nothing and
  would never be noticed)
