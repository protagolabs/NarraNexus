@description: A connection whose event loop died must not keep the database
hostage.

The failure this guards (found 2026-08-17 while profiling the suite):

  1. A short-lived event loop closes with a DB statement still in flight.
     This codebase mints such loops on purpose: `get_db_client_sync()` builds
     its client inside `asyncio.run(...)`, `lark_trigger` makes a fresh loop
     per WS reconnect, and one-shot scripts / migrations / this very test
     harness do the same. (NOT the MCP container — `module_runner.py` gives
     each module its own PROCESS with one process-lifetime `asyncio.run`.)
  2. The loop closes with that statement still in flight.
  3. aiosqlite's worker thread answers by calling `call_soon_threadsafe` on the
     closed loop, which raises; its `except` handler makes the SAME call again,
     raises again, uncaught — and the worker thread dies holding an open
     sqlite3 connection.
  4. Nobody can close that connection any more, so its lock is held for the
     life of the process. Every later writer waits out `busy_timeout` (30s) on
     each of `_MAX_WRITE_RETRIES` (10) attempts: ~321s, then
     "database is locked".

Six such collisions were 92% of the test suite's 38-minute wall clock, and
every one of them was reported as a PASSING test — which is exactly why this
file exists. The symptom is "slow", so nothing red ever pointed at it.

Both halves are asserted here, because either one alone leaves the hazard: the
worker thread has to survive (only it can close the connection), and
`db_factory` has to actually close what it evicts (nothing else will).

Timing is staged, never slept for: a blocker connection holds the write lock so
the statement is GUARANTEED to still be in flight when its loop closes. A repro
that races is a repro that goes green on its own the first time it is
inconvenient.
