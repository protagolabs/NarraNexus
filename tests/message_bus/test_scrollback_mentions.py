@description: Which lines in the room were aimed at whom.

The scrollback rendered every message as `Name: text` and dropped the one field
that says who it was for. `BusMessage.mentions` has always been there and the
team prompt never read it, so a room where three people are being coordinated
arrives as undifferentiated chatter and the agent has to guess which lines
concern it.

Worse at the pointer: when several messages @mentioned this agent in one batch,
the prompt named only `trigger_messages[-1]`. The earlier ones sat in the
scrollback looking like everyone else's traffic — asked and silently dropped,
which reads to the user as the agent ignoring them.

Pinned here:
  * a line that @mentioned someone says so
  * a line aimed at THIS agent is marked as such, not just attributed
  * every message in the batch that called this agent is pointed at, in order
  * an unaddressed line stays clean — no empty annotation
