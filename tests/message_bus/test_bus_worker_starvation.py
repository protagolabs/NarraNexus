@date: 2026-08-14
@description: The worker pool running dry becomes visible instead of implicit.

`liveness_snapshot()` has carried `running` / `waiting` / `max_workers` since
the 2026-07-27 wedge, and its docstring already names the signal: sustained
`running == max_workers` with `waiting > 0` means the POOL is the bottleneck,
not the agents. Nobody reads it. It goes into a heartbeat row and stops there.

That matters for PRD "Team chat responsiveness" specifically, because slot wait is
inside `queue_wait_ms` — the column acceptance #1 is judged on. A starved pool
shows up as "the bus got slower" with no way to tell it from "the agents got
slower".

The threshold is WALL CLOCK, not a cycle count, and these tests drive a fake
clock to say so. The first implementation counted cycles and looked correct
under test — because a test loop makes cycles instantaneous. On a live instance
it silently missed a real 28-second starvation: `_poll_cycle` returns zero
dispatches while candidates queue behind the semaphore, so the adaptive
interval backs off 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 12s, and 28 seconds of shortage produced only
FOUR cycles against a five-cycle threshold. Poll cycles get rarer exactly when
starvation is happening. Hence `test_cycle_frequency_does_not_change_the_verdict`.

What is pinned here:

* an alert fires only after the condition HOLDS for `STARVATION_ALERT_AFTER_S`
  — one busy moment is a working pool, not an incident,
* how OFTEN the check runs cannot change the verdict,
* a single free slot resets the episode,
* the alert repeats at most once per episode, so a pool that stays saturated
  for an hour writes one row and not sixty,
* it is DIAGNOSTIC ONLY: nothing is cancelled, no turn is force-stopped, and
  the alert never reaches the owner's inbox (binding rule #14 — a long run is a
  legitimate workload, and a slot shortage is a platform problem the owner
  cannot fix anyway).
