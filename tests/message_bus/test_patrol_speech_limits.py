@description: Patrol speaks outside the cascade cap — so its own limit is the
only backstop left.

Owner decision 2026-08-07 (option a): a patrol message is the PLATFORM taking
stock, not an agent joining the conversation, so it neither pushes the cascade
depth up nor has its @mentions stripped.

That decision is load-bearing in both directions:

* without the exemption, patrol fails exactly where it is needed. The broken
  flow IS a long unbroken run of agent messages with no user in between, so
  depth is already at the cap and the chase @ would be stripped — silently.
* with the exemption, the runaway-@ protection no longer covers patrol, and
  the only thing standing between a confused model and a flooded room is the
  counter tested here. Which is why it lives in the DB: the bus's existing
  limiter is an in-memory dict keyed on `time.monotonic()`, and a backstop a
  restart erases is not a backstop.
