@description: The team-room prompt asks for replies with substance, not for
replies to everything.

Owner feedback on 2026-09-03: "team collaboration is too verbose; agents
interacting with each other is exhausting". One dev room was the exhibit — a
19-character question followed by 23 agent messages, each opening with 收到,
restating a correction the previous message had accepted, and @mentioning
both other members. The prompt had been asking for exactly that: "Address ALL
of them" made an FYI owe a reply, and "hand it to whoever is the better owner
by @mentioning them" made hand-off the default move.

These pin the replacement wording. A prompt test is a weak test, and the
repository knows it (iron rule #15: the prompt is not the guard) — the guards
are `opens_handoffs` and the silent-turn marker, tested elsewhere. This one
only stops the two contradictory instructions from creeping back.
