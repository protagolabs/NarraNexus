@description: Agents can enumerate the team folder instead of being told.

Before the index there was no way to ask what a team had shared: the folder
holds files named by generated id, so the only discovery channel was another
agent reciting an absolute path in the room. That made "did you get the file"
a social protocol between models — it worked exactly as often as the models
remembered to narrate.

Membership is checked server-side against team_members. agent_id arrives from
the identity headers, but the membership check is what actually bounds this:
one user owns many teams, so being the owner's agent is not permission to read
any of that owner's teams.
