@description: The orchestrator's steer decision — when a team lane is already
running, a new @mention is routed INTO the live run (steer_inbox + a push
onto its SteerChannel) and the processing cursor advances, instead of
waiting for the turn to end and dispatching a fresh one.

Steering only ever carries messages NEWER than what the running turn already
rendered (its ``_InFlight.rendered_through`` high-water); the turn's own trigger
batch is already in its prompt and must not be re-injected. And the processing
cursor is FORWARD-ONLY, so the turn's own end-ack cannot pull it back behind the
messages steering already delivered.

Uses the shared factory client (``get_db_client``) for the bus AND the
steer inbox, because that is what ``_route_steer`` reaches for — the two
must be one database, exactly as in production.
