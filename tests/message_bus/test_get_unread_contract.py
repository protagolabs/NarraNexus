@description: What `get_unread` promises — it had no contract, and it showed.

This is the query behind the `### Unread Messages` block that rides every turn's
context, in every scenario. It had three defects at once and none of them were
covered:

  * **it counted the agent's own posts.** `get_pending_messages` has excluded
    `from_agent = me` since it was written; this one never did, so an agent that
    posts in a busy room reads its own words back as somebody's unanswered
    message.
  * **it returned the OLDEST N.** `ORDER BY created_at ASC` with no SQL LIMIT,
    truncated in Python. Paired with a cursor that never advanced, every turn
    got the same frozen window of the most ancient messages — the opposite of
    "what is going on right now". `get_recent_messages` already documents the
    fix (DESC + reversed); this one just never adopted it.
  * **it had no LIMIT at all**, so the whole backlog crossed the wire to be
    thrown away in a slice.

One caller must NOT get a limit, and that is the point of the last test here:
the module's post-turn hook asks for the full set to decide which messages a
reply covers. Hand it the newest 20 and every older answered message stays
unread forever — a worse bug than the one being fixed, and a silent one.
