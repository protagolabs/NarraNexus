@date: 2026-05-12
@description: Lock the per-LANE serialisation contract on
              ``MessageBusTrigger._process_lane``.

Why this file exists:
    Without the lock, the poller calling ``_process_lane`` twice for the same
    lane while a slow ``_invoke_runtime`` is in flight would fire
    ``AgentRuntime`` twice for the same pending bus message — because
    ``last_processed_at`` is only advanced after the first runtime returns.
    Observed in production (2026-05-12 13:20 — msg_4eb528dc processed 3x
    by agent_d8795abf5021, burning ~30K tokens for one duplicate reply).

    The lock's key is the LANE ``(agent_id, channel_id)``, not the agent:
    the duplicate risk is per-message, hence per-channel, so per-lane keeping
    is enough — AND it lets one agent's several teams run at once, which is the
    point (a message in team B must not wait behind the agent's team-A turn).

    These tests assert that:

    1. Concurrent calls for the SAME lane serialise.
    2. Concurrent calls for DIFFERENT agents run in parallel.
    3. Concurrent calls for the SAME agent on DIFFERENT channels run in
       parallel (multi-team concurrency — the 2026-08-21 change).
