@description: get_pending_messages(channel_id=...) scopes the LIMIT to ONE
room. The per-lane trigger needs this: an agent with a backlog in a busy room
A must still see a new message in room B. Without SQL scoping the cross-channel
LIMIT fills with A's rows and B is filtered to empty in Python → B starves and
burns a worker slot every poll. Delete the `AND m.channel_id` clause and the
scoped assertion below goes red.
