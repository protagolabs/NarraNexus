@description: The handoff gap — a reply into the room wakes the poll at once.

PRD "Team chat responsiveness" acceptance #5: a three-hop relay must never
show a zero-sign window. The gap it is
about is not inside a turn, it is BETWEEN turns. A finishes and posts; B is
mentioned in that post; B waits for the next poll tick to be noticed. At the
adaptive interval that is 3-12s of nothing happening, per hop, and it stacks
with every relay.

The fix is one `asyncio.Event`: a successful team-room post sets it, and the
poll loop's sleep waits on it as well as on stop. The room's own delivery is
what schedules the next hop, instead of a timer noticing later.

Scope, stated because it is easy to over-read: this covers every post made by
the TRIGGER process — the team-room reply and the leader patrol, both routed
through `_post_to_room`. An agent that calls the
`bus_send` MCP tool posts from the MCP server process, where an in-process
Event cannot reach; that path still waits for the poll. Team relay — the PRD's
subject — is covered; peer DM via the tool is not.

The second half of this file pins the property acceptance #5 actually states:
across a three-hop relay there is no sampling point where the room shows every
member idle while a message sits unprocessed. That is the machine-checkable
form of "no dead silence".
