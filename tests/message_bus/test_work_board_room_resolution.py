@description: How a work-board tool learns which team room it is running in.

`test_work_board_tools.py` monkeypatches `_resolve_team_room` wholesale so the
tools' own logic is what it tests. Nothing then covered the resolver itself —
which is how the patrol lane shipped with every board tool dead on it: patrol
opened no `bus_agent_activity` row, the resolver's only source at the time, so
all five tools returned "no room" / "not found" in the one turn the prompt
explicitly asks the lead to call `work_complete_item`.

Pinned here:
  * the server-injected team identity is the FIRST source, so a lane that does
    not write an activity row still resolves (the patrol case)
  * the room's channel is derived from the team, not from where the agent
    happens to be mirrored
  * no injected team and no activity row = no board, never a guess
  * a non-team channel is not a team room
