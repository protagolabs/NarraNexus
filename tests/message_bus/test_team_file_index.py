@description: The team shared folder gets an index.

Files were staged to disk under a generated file_id and nothing was written
to the database, so the folder could not be enumerated: agents recited
absolute paths at each other in chat and users had no entry point at all.

De-duplication is the interesting part, and it is asymmetric on purpose:

  same name + same bytes       one file re-shared -> reuse the row
  same name + different bytes  two different files -> keep BOTH

Collapsing the second case would be a silent destructive write — the newer
share would take the older one's place with no way back. Keying dedup on the
name alone does exactly that, which is why the content hash is not optional.

Hashing reads the whole file, so the lookup is gated behind a cheap
(team, name, size) index probe. Note the honest limit of that: a brand-new
file IS still hashed once, because the digest has to be stored for any later
comparison to be possible. The pre-filter keeps a share to ONE read of the
source instead of one per candidate row — it does not make new files free.
