@description: The bulletin's contract with the prompt — the acceptance
criterion the whole feature exists for.

The PRD's complaint is precise: a rule the user stated once falls out of every
member's view as soon as 20 messages have gone by, because the 20-message
scrollback is a team turn's ONLY continuity. So the property to pin is not
"the bulletin appears somewhere" but "it appears regardless of what the
scrollback happens to contain" — including when the scrollback is empty, which
is exactly the state a newly-added member starts in.

Position is also load-bearing and asserted here. The bulletin goes BEFORE the
conversation: it is the standing constraint the messages are read under, and a
block appended after twenty lines of chat reads as a footnote to them.

The zero-cost case is a stated acceptance criterion, not an optimisation. An
empty bulletin that still emitted a header would put "[Team Bulletin]\\n(none)"
into every turn of every team that never uses the feature.
