@description: The lead's role, stated to the lead.

`teams.lead_agent_id` had exactly two consumers before this: the default
responder for un-@mentioned messages, and a badge in the roster UI. On the
AGENT side it meant nothing — the lead did not know it was the lead, which is
why "the Leader should chase stalled work" had nowhere to attach.

Pinned here:
  * the lead is told it is the lead, and told what that obliges
  * a non-lead member gets none of it (its prompt must not grow a
    responsibility it does not have)
  * the board's current contents ride the same prompt, so "what is on my
    board" never depends on the model remembering to call a tool
