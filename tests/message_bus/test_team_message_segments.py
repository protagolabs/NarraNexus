@description: Carrying the monologue/reply boundary from the run to the wall.

`run_collector` preserves the boundary; this is the rest of the path — bus
write, storage, read back — so the room can lay deliberation out differently
from an answer.

Two properties are load-bearing and pinned here:

  * `content` does not change. It is what every TEXT consumer reads: the memory
    index, and other agents' scrollback. A rendering feature must not rewrite
    the thing the rest of the system reads.
  * Absent segments are normal, not an error. Every message written before this
    change has none, and per iron rule #2 there is no backfill and no
    compatibility shim — the reader renders those as one block, which is exactly
    today's behaviour.

    These two tests pinned the monologue/reply boundary travelling from the run to

    could lay deliberation out differently from the answer.

    That boundary no longer EXISTS for a team reply. The reply is now the argument
    of a tool call, and the agent's deliberation stays private — so there is no
    "monologue half" of a room message to render. The room showing an agent
    thinking out loud is a feature this change removes, deliberately: it existed
    only because the reply and the thinking were the same text.

    The storage half of this file is untouched and still passes — `segments` is
    still a real column with real semantics (absent = one block), and the bulletin
    and IM paths can still use it. What is pinned here is that the ROOM path
    writes none, so nobody re-adds a half-wired boundary later and wonders why the
