@date: 2026-08-17
@description: Acceptance for the whole delivery change — the agent's own tool call.

Every other team test stubs the delivery: it calls `post_team_reply` (or, before
2026-08-17, the trigger's deliverer) directly. That leaves the seam this change is
ABOUT untested — the MCP tool itself, with its identity headers, its three
membership gates, its room resolution and its return shape. Two bugs in this
change lived exactly there and were invisible to the rest of the suite:
`_describe_agent` did not exist, and the hop cap read `.placeholder` off a client
that has none, so every call returned `{"success": false}` while the room stayed
silent.

So this drives the REAL registered tool, on a real database, from inside a real
`_process_agent` dispatch, and asserts what a person in the room would notice:

  * the words are in the room, once, attributed to the agent
  * an @mention resolved, so the hand-off can continue
  * the turn is stamped, so the transcript can open it
  * the poll loop was told to look again (else the next hop waits 3-12s)
  * the platform did NOT add a "said nothing" notice on top of a turn that spoke
  * the read cursor advanced, so the same message is not re-answered next turn
