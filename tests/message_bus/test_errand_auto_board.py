@description: The errand layer — a hand-off gets onto the board without anyone
              remembering to put it there.

The work board (#259) can already notice a stalled task, tighten its cadence
and chase the assignee. Its ENTRANCE, though, was `work_add_item`: a tool the
Leader has to remember to call. So the whole guard rested on model obedience —
the dependency iron rule #15 exists to keep off correctness-critical paths —
and the founding case walks straight through it: nobody called the tool during
the Dunhuang chain, so the board was empty and patrol had nothing to sweep.

This is the message-level half the owner specified on 2026-08-07: "an errand is
a MESSAGE-level fact recorded automatically (A @ B opens it, B's reply closes
it)". Opening without closing would be strictly worse than nothing — every
casual "@Bruno 你怎么看" would pile onto the board and patrol would chase it
forever — so the two halves ship together and are tested together.

The one rule that carries the incident: **a promise does not close an errand.**
"收到，开始处理……完成后交付 @A4" is the exact text that ended the Dunhuang run,
and treating it as delivery would hand the guard back to the failure it exists
to catch.
