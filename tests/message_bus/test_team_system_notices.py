@description: Things the room did that the room never mentioned.

Two events changed what the team could do and left no trace anywhere the user
looks:

**The cascade cap.** When agent hops pile up since the last human message, the
platform stops propagating @mentions so two agents cannot loop forever. That is
the right behaviour — and it was recorded only in a server log. From the room it
looks like the agent asked a teammate to help and the teammate ignored it. The
user asked for someone to be pulled in; the platform declined; nobody said so.

**Turn failure is a different case, and worth stating precisely**: it was
already visible, because the trigger returns "I couldn't process your message"
as the reply text. But it is posted AS THE AGENT, with the agent's name and
colour, as if the agent had said it. It is not attribution that is missing — it
is correct attribution.
