@description: End-to-end regression for the 2026-06-30 Dunhuang broken chain.

The founding incident: A3 answered a hand-off with "收到，开始处理……完成后交付
@A4", the run ended `completed` with that promise as its whole `final_output`,
and the six-stage pipeline died there in total silence. No error, no timeout,
no visible "this hand-off is still owed" anywhere.

The per-unit tests around this (`test_patrol_stall_detection`,
`test_patrol_candidates`, `test_patrol_turn`) each pin one link. What none of
them pin is the CHAIN: the whole point is that the detection, the cadence
switch, the candidate sweep and the prompt have to compose, because the
incident was a chain failure and any single working link would still have let
it happen.

Two residuals are pinned here too, deliberately as characterisation:

* a promise-shaped reply IS a delivery, so the undelivered-notice path (#296)
  cannot see the Dunhuang shape at all — the work board is the only mechanism
  that can;
* `events` carries a flat `root_run_id` tree LABEL and no parent pointer, so
  "which run caused this run" is still unanswerable (the acceptance criterion
  asking for the parent run is not satisfiable today).

If either becomes false, this file should be updated rather than deleted — a
change there is a real product change, not a test artefact.
