@description: Real-MySQL coverage for the unread cursor's hand-written SQL.

Three new raw statements land in `local_bus.py` with this change: `ack_read`'s
guarded UPDATE, `count_unread`'s COUNT, and `get_unread`'s two-parameter WHERE.
The SQLite suite structurally cannot see a dialect error in any of them —
`LocalMessageBus._db` is the RAW backend, so what SQLite runs and what MySQL
runs are not the same text.

Project policy for new raw SQL, same as `test_cascade_stop_mysql.py` and
`test_team_work_repository_mysql.py`.

Enable with a throwaway MySQL DSN:

    export NARRANEXUS_MYSQL_TEST_URL=\\
        "mysql://root:xyz_root_pass@127.0.0.1:3306/xyz_agent_context"

    """The third reader of `_unread_predicate`, and the only one doing timestamp work.

    `has_unread_before` adds `AND m.created_at < %s` with `canonical_ts(before)`.
    On SQLite `created_at` is TEXT and that is a lexicographic string compare; on
    MySQL it is `DATETIME(6)` and the engine casts the string. `canonical_ts` is
    `value.isoformat()` over a value whose type came from whichever backend parsed
    the row, so the two engines are fed different literal SHAPES into the same
    comparison — the case a twin exists for.

    If the cast degrades on MySQL the method returns False, its caller skips its
    early return, and `ack_read` advances the cursor to the trigger message —
    permanently marking as read every unread message older than the rendered
    window. Irreversible context loss on the cloud deploy, and the call is wrapped
    in `except Exception`, so even a hard failure degrades to a warning line. This
    lane has already been bitten by a timestamp comparison once (`canonical_ts`'s
    own docstring: "That cost us a re-trigger loop once").

    `before` is taken from a `BusMessage.created_at` READ BACK FROM MySQL, not
    hand-written: a literal built in Python proves nothing about the shape
    mismatch, which is the whole point.

    Also asserts the interleaved parameter tuple parses on a real engine — this is
    the one caller whose prefix params sit between the predicate's own and its
    extras.
