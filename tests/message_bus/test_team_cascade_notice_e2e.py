@description: The capped-cascade notice, driven through the real turn.

The notice itself and its wiring were pinned separately: the notice by its own
unit tests, the wiring by `inspect.getsource` assertions that the batch handler
mentions `post_cascade_capped`. Source assertions were the honest choice at the
time — the only test that reached this path returned a tuple where production
reads `turn.text`, so everything past that line raised, got swallowed, and never
ran. Nothing behavioural COULD reach it.

With that stub fixed, this path is reachable, so it is tested by running it: a
room already at the hop limit, an agent that answers with an @mention, and the
question of whether the room is told the mention went nowhere.

The `@all` case is here rather than only in the unit tests because it is the one
that was broken end to end while both halves passed on their own — the notice
knew how to say it, the caller filtered it out before asking.
