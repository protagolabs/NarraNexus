@description: When a bus message stops counting as unread — and when it must not.

`bus_channel_members` carries two cursors and they answer different questions:
``last_processed_at`` is "the trigger drove this agent past here", ``last_read_at``
is "this agent has actually been shown it". Only the second one gates the unread
list that rides every turn's context.

Nothing advanced `last_read_at` in a team room. Its only writer keys off a bus
delivery tool appearing in the turn's trace, and a team reply is posted by the
trigger itself — server-side, no tool call — so the cursor sat at `joined_at`
forever. Every team message stayed unread for the rest of the agent's life, and
those messages ride EVERY scenario's context, owner chat included.

The fix is not "advance it wherever the trigger acks". Two of the four ack sites
run no turn at all, and the distinction is the whole point:

  * a turn ran → the room's scrollback was rendered into the prompt → the agent
    HAS seen those messages, whether or not it chose to reply;
  * no turn ran (not @mentioned, or rate-limited) → the agent has seen nothing.
    Marking those read would delete them unseen, and would take with them the
    one way an un-mentioned member ever learns what its room is up to.

Pinned here:
  * a team turn advances `last_read_at`, reply or silence
  * a stopped team turn advances it too — the prompt was still built
  * not being @mentioned does NOT advance it (the "glance at the room" path)
  * being rate-limited does NOT advance it
  * a peer DM keeps its selective mark_read semantics: no reply, still unread
