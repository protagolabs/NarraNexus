@description: `read_history` takes conversation HANDLES, not channel ids.

The redesign's premise is that an agent's world holds private conversations and
teams — not channels. `read_history(agent_id, channel_id, limit)` was the one
tool that contradicted it, and the contradiction was load-bearing: to call it,
the agent needed an id, so the instruction printed a `### Your Channels` list of
raw `channel_id`s and `channel_type`s into every turn. Removing the list without
changing the tool would have left the tool uncallable; changing the tool is what
let the list go.

The membership assertions are the ones that matter. Both lookups are written so
the AUTHORISATION IS THE QUERY — the DM join requires the caller to be one of
the two members, the team branch requires a `team_members` row — rather than
"find the channel, then check". The second shape is one forgotten branch away
from an agent reading a conversation it is not in, and that branch is exactly
the kind that gets added while fixing something else.
