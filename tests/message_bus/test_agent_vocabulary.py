@description: Words the agent must never be shown, checked across every surface
              that reaches it.

Spec §10.4 asked for this test and §8 states the acceptance criterion it checks:
the subsystem's name appears in NO agent-visible text. It was not written, and
the cost was measurable — a review found eleven live strings naming a retired
owner tool, five `"MessageBus not available"` errors returned straight to the
model, a `find_agent` tool description advertising "the MessageBus registry",
and a `### Your Channels` heading printing raw channel ids into every turn. Each
one was individually obvious; what was missing was anything that looked at all
of them at once.

Why a vocabulary test rather than more per-string assertions: the redesign's
whole claim is that the agent's world has exactly two kinds of conversation in
it. That claim is falsified by ANY leaked third concept — a transport, a channel
id, an internal prefix, a tool that no longer exists — and which one leaks next
is unpredictable, whereas the vocabulary is a closed list. Per-string tests
guard the strings someone already thought of.

The surfaces collected here are the ones the model actually reads: the module's
byte-stable instruction block, its per-turn span, every MCP tool description
(the docstring IS the description), and the trigger prompts. If a new surface
appears, add it — a banned word is only banned where someone looks.
