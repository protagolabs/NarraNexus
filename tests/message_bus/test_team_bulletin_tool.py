@description: Agents can pin a rule the team agreed on — and only that.

方案 B lets the team sediment its own conventions ("we settled on report
format v2") instead of the user restating them. That is only safe because the
authority is asymmetric, and the asymmetry is what these tests pin:

  * an agent may add, and may retract WHAT IT ITSELF WROTE;
  * an agent may never touch a user's entry. Otherwise a model that finds a
    rule inconvenient can delete the rule constraining it — and the bulletin
    is exactly where the constraining rules live;
  * an agent may never touch the auto-summary, which no one authored and
    which it would otherwise be able to rewrite into an instruction.

The team a write lands in comes from the SERVER-SIDE identity of the turn, not
from a tool argument. `bus_share_to_team` takes team_id from the model and
checks it three ways; here the stronger option exists because the turn already
carries its team, so naming another team is not a permission failure to catch
— it is not expressible. A private turn therefore has no bulletin to write to
at all.
