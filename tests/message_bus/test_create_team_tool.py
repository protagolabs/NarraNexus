@description: `create_team` builds a REAL team, not an orphan bus channel.

The tool sits in the byte-stable instruction block, so the model calls it every
bus turn. Before this test it just renamed `bus_create_channel`: no `teams` row,
no `team_members` row, `created_by = the creator agent` (so the creator became
the always-activated channel owner), and it returned a `channel_id` the agent
had no verb to use — `message_team` looks the team up in `teams` and got None.

The load-bearing assertion is the end-to-end one: create_team -> message_team
must SUCCEED. Revert create_team to `bus.create_channel(...)` and it goes red on
"team not found for this owner".
