@description: The defect the inbox rework is justified by, on the LIVE database.

Until 2026-08-17 `ChannelInboxWriter` mirrored every IM turn into `bus_messages`
so the Inbox could display it, under a channel nobody ever marked read. The
consequence, measured on prod: 1,364 messages permanently unread, riding into 90
agents' context every single turn, attributed to pseudo-agents like
`lark_user_<id>`.

Moving the inbox to its own tables stops NEW rows. It does nothing about the rows
already on every deployed database — and `_unread_predicate` is what hands them to
the model. So without this filter the rework would ship, the schema comment would
say the containment is "structural", and 90 agents would keep getting the same
poisoned context afterwards. The purge is a manual post-deploy step (the owner's
call, see the backfill runbook); the injection had to stop on the deploy.

Asserted through the three real readers, not through the predicate string: they
share `_unread_predicate` precisely so they cannot disagree, and "N unread (showing
M)" lying about its own list is the failure a divergence produces.

    These were two methods reading `im_channel_prefixes()` separately, with nothing
    tying the number of emitted placeholders to the length of the returned tuple.
    Merging them into one method was not sufficient either: the SQL came from a
    generator and the params from `tuple(prefixes)`, so a condition added to the
    generator left the params unfiltered. Mutation-verified at the time — adding
    `if len(pfx) > 6` to the generator passed the whole suite.

    The failure that shift produces is the bad kind. `has_unread_before` is the one
    caller that INTERLEAVES its parameters, so one extra param means
    `m.channel_id = ?` receives a prefix string and `m.created_at < ?` receives a
    channel id. The query matches nothing, `has_unread_before` returns False, the
    caller skips its early return, and `ack_read` advances the cursor — discarding
    every unread message older than the rendered window. No exception, and no test
    failure unless a fixture happens to hold the right number of prefixes.

    Clause and param are appended together in one loop now, so a `continue` drops
    both. This test states the invariant the loop provides.
