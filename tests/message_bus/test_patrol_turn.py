@description: The patrol turn itself — when it speaks, and when it stays quiet.

A patrol that narrated every sweep would be a second kind of noise in a room
the product already fought to keep quiet (the folded console, the lingering
activity bubble). So: silence is the normal outcome, and the cursor moves
either way.

Also pinned here: a patrol message is the PLATFORM speaking. It posts under
the room's own marker, not as the lead, which is what keeps it out of the
agent-hop count (owner decision 2026-08-07, option a).

    The hop cap exists to break agent-to-agent @mention loops. Patrol is the

    is usually one the cap has already stopped relaying — so applying the cap to
    patrol would mute it exactly when it is needed.

    rather than assumed: with the speech budget exhausted, patrol posts nothing at
    all, so it cannot re-mention a stalled assignee however deep the room's
    cascade already is. If someone later removes the speech cap, this fails here
