@date: 2026-08-04
@description: MessageBusModule declares the bus delivery tools as the turn's
reply surface — but ONLY on bus-triggered turns (NexusPower reply contract,
origin-aware declaration).

Why gating matters both ways:
- A bus-triggered turn without this declaration tells the model (via the
  framework's per-step reply reminder) that ONLY the owner-chat tool
  delivers — so finished work ends as undelivered plain text, or gets
  misdelivered to the owner's web chat (2026-08-01 briefing-squad incident).
- A chat turn WITH this declaration would invite replying to the owner via
  the bus.

2026-08-17 — what a team turn declares FLIPPED, and the reason is worth keeping.
It used to declare NOTHING, because the room auto-posted the agent's plain text
and naming a delivery tool would have invited double-posting. That made the team
room the one surface in the system where "plain text reaches nobody" was false,
and the contradictions growing out of that exception cost six review rounds on
PR #311. The room now takes a tool call like everywhere else, so the hazard the
empty declaration guarded against no longer exists — and an empty surface would
now be the misinformation, telling the model nothing can deliver on a turn where
`message_team` is exactly what does.

Drift guards mirror tests/chat_module/test_expressive_declaration.py: the
declaration derives from get_mcp_config().server_name, and the short names
must be tools the bus MCP server actually registers.
