@file_name: test_cross_process_wake.py
@date: 2026-08-17
@description: A send from ANOTHER process wakes the poll loop too.

`_wake` (2026-08-14) closed the between-turns gap for posts made by the TRIGGER
process, and said so in its own docstring: an agent replying through an MCP tool
posts from the MCP server, where an in-process `asyncio.Event` cannot reach, so
that path still waited out the adaptive interval (3-12s). The mirror recorded the
remedy and deferred it — "要跨进程就得上 DB 信号 + 读取方,等 peer DM 延迟真成为抱怨
再说".

The harness redesign makes it a requirement rather than a nicety: a team reply
becomes a TOOL CALL (`message_team`), so the room's own relay moves onto exactly
the path the in-process Event never covered. Without a cross-process wake, moving
team delivery to a tool would hand back part of the latency win measured in
`c7739ad1` — a regression the user feels as the room going quiet.

So the signal lives at the ONE seam every send already passes through
(`LocalMessageBus.send_message` — the only `bus_messages` insert in the repo),
and the poll loop reads it while it sleeps. That placement also retires the
structural guard in `test_bus_relay_wake`: "post without a wake" stops being a
mistake a caller can make, because the wake is inside the write.
