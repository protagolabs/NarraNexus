@description: One place that fakes "the agent spoke in the room".

Before 2026-08-17 a team reply was the agent's PLAIN TEXT and the trigger posted
it, so every team-turn test stubbed `_invoke_runtime` and called the
`on_plain_text_delivery` callback the trigger handed in. That callback is gone —
the room is a tool call (`message_team`) now — so a stub that skips it would be
asserting about a path production no longer takes.

What replaces it has to go through `team_posting.post_team_reply`, because that
is what the tool calls and where @mention resolution, the hop cap and the cap's
narration live. A stub that inserted a `bus_messages` row directly would pass
while none of that ran.

Kept in one module rather than copied into a dozen test files: the shape of "the
agent spoke" is exactly the kind of thing that drifts per-file and then a
contract change like this one has to be made a dozen times.
