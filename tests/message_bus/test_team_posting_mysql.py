@description: Real-MySQL coverage for the team-posting lane's hand-written SQL.

Two new raw statements arrive with the harness redesign, both on paths that run
on ordinary traffic rather than on an error branch:

  * `team_posting.team_cascade_depth` — the hop cap. Its `NOT IN (…)` list is
    built from a variable number of placeholders, and it is the guard that stops
    an @mention cascade from looping. When it raised, it did not degrade to "no
    cap": it took the whole send down, and every `message_team` returned
    `{"success": false}`.
  * `_message_bus_mcp_tools._resolve_conversation` — the DM lookup behind
    `read_history`, a three-way join whose two joined member rows ARE the
    authorisation.

The SQLite suite structurally cannot see a dialect error in either: these run
through `AsyncDatabaseClient`, which rewrites `%s` per backend, so what SQLite
executes and what MySQL executes are different text. `bus_wake` is exercised
too — one row updated on every send is the shape where the two engines' upsert
and locking semantics differ most, and `wake_signal.bump` fails open, so a
dialect error there would be invisible except as messages arriving late.

Project policy for new raw SQL, same as `test_unread_cursor_mysql.py` and
`test_cascade_stop_mysql.py`.

Enable with a throwaway MySQL DSN:
