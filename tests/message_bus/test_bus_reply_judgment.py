@description: "Did this turn deliver to whoever contacted the agent?" —
pinned at its REAL consumer, not just the handler data.

2026-08-01 briefing-squad incident: agents that DID deliver via
``message_team`` were recorded NO-REPLY. The handler's
``user_reply_tool_names`` now carries the bus delivery tools, and the
live consumer is ChatModule's background-persistence split: a bus turn
that delivered to its origin writes a [DELIVERED-BG] activity row (and
an honest summary), only a genuinely silent turn writes [NO-REPLY-BG].
That split is the no-reply metric the fallback decision reads — round-2
review caught that after the owner-visible separation the expanded list
briefly had NO live consumer and the metric stayed poisoned.
