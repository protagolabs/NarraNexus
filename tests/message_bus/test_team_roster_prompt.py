@description: The roster — who else is here, what they do, and are they busy.

The room used to introduce its members as a comma-separated list of display
names. Three things followed from that and all three were product problems:

  * **"who should I @" was unanswerable.** The prompt instructs the agent to
    pull a teammate in by @mentioning them, while giving it nothing to choose
    on. A team degrades into strangers who @ whoever spoke last.
  * **two surfaces, two identifier systems.** The roster hands out display
    names; `bus_send_to_agent` wants an `agent_id`. The agent had to guess the
    mapping between them.
  * **nobody could tell whether a teammate was mid-task.** The activity mirror
    has fed the UI's roster for months; no agent could read it, so "don't
    interrupt someone who is working" was not a decision anyone could make.

Pinned here:
  * a row per member, in the same shape as Known Agents (`id` — name: desc)
  * the agent itself appears, marked
  * the lead is marked, and non-leads can see who it is
  * a live teammate shows a duration; an idle one shows nothing at all
  * `phase` never reaches the prompt
