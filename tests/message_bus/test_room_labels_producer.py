@description: `_room_labels` against a real database — the PRODUCER, not the
              renderer.

`test_turn_context_split.py` covers what the tag renders by putting
`bus_room_labels` into `extra_data` by hand. That left the function that builds
the map with no test at all, and it shipped broken: the two queries used `%s`
against `bus._db`, which is the RAW backend, where `%s` is not a placeholder.
Both raised, the fail-open swallowed it, and on SQLite the map was ALWAYS empty —
so every team-room message rendered in the private-conversation form, the one
mislabelling the function's own docstring says must not happen. On MySQL it
worked, so the desktop and the cloud disagreed (铁律 #7) with nothing in the logs
above debug.

6433 passing tests did not touch it. A renderer test that supplies its own input
proves the renderer; it says nothing about where the input comes from.
