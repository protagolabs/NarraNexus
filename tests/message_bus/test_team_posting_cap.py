@description: The hop cap has to RUN on the path the tool actually takes.

`team_cascade_depth` was lifted out of `MessageBusTrigger`, where `self._bus._db`
is the RAW backend and SQL goes through verbatim. Every caller of the extracted
function holds an `AsyncDatabaseClient` instead, which has no `.placeholder` — so
reading one raised inside the cap check and took the whole send with it: every
`message_team` call returned `{"success": false}` while the room stayed silent.

It surfaced only as a log line during an unrelated test, which is why this file
exists: the cap is a loop-breaker, and a loop-breaker that raises is worse than
one that is absent, because the send fails too.

    """The invariant the hop cap actually rests on, on the LIVE implementation.

    The depth query reads a fixed `LIMIT MAX_TEAM_AGENT_HOPS + 2` newest-first
    and counts agent rows until it meets a human one. Platform notices inside
    that window do two things at once: they pad the count, and they push the
    human message — the reset — out of the window entirely. So filtering them
    out AFTER the fetch cannot work; the exclusion has to be in the WHERE.

    Laid out so the two readings differ by a definite number rather than by a
    threshold. One user message, three real hops, then four platform notices:

      * exclusion in SQL   -> hop3, hop2, hop1, usr  -> depth 3 (correct)
      * filtered afterwards -> 4 notices + hop3, hop2 -> depth 6, and the user
        message is never reached, so the reset is invisible

    Six is over the cap, so the room would start stripping @mentions off a
    three-hop chain the user had just restarted. The previous version of this
    test asserted `depth >= MAX_TEAM_AGENT_HOPS`, which BOTH readings satisfy —
    it was green on the mutation, and so was the copy of it that used to live in
    `test_patrol_turn.py` against the trigger's now-deleted `_team_cascade_depth`.
    The invariant was documented, not tested.

    There is a MySQL twin in `test_team_posting_mysql.py` — the exclusion is
    written in SQL, so it is dialect-visible — and this is the lane that runs on
    every commit.

    the "said nothing" notice is suppressed and the turn files as DELIVERED. The
    pre-redesign silence at least produced a notice.

    Two layers, because they catch different callers: the tool refuses with an
    error the model can act on (a `success: true` no-op would teach it that it
    replied), and `post_team_reply` raises — production cannot reach that, since
    the tool guards first, so anything arriving there skipped the tool. The test
    helper `speak_in_room` is such a caller, which is the point: without this a
