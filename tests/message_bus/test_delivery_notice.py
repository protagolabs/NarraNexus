@description: The platform says so when a turn delivered nothing.

Three silences the room used to keep (PRD 2026-08-04, "看到的必须是真的"):

* a team turn that produced no reply text — the room stayed empty and the
  user read it as the agent ignoring them;
* the room post itself failing — backend green, billing charged, room empty;
* an A2A turn that neither answered the peer nor said anything to its owner —
  the asking agent waited forever.

All three now write a platform line. These tests pin the contract that makes
those lines safe to add: best-effort (a notice that cannot be posted must not
break the turn), platform-typed (so no consumer counts them as team activity),
and honest about the error without leaking a credential into the transcript.
