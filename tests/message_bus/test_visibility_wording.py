@description: The module's standing rules must be true in every room it reaches.

`_static_instruction_parts` is emitted on every bus-enabled turn with no idea
what kind of room the turn is in — that is the point of it, and the R4 cache
depends on it staying byte-identical. So anything it asserts has to hold
everywhere, and two lines did not:

  * "In group channels, you only see messages that @mention you." True for an
    ordinary bus group. False in a team room, whose turn prompt carries the
    room's full recent scrollback and says so ten lines later. Two contradictory
    claims about the same room, in the same context window.
  * "Ignored messages resurface — they stay unread and appear again next turn."
    True in a DM, where the unread list is the queue. False in a team room since
    the read cursor started advancing on a rendered turn.

The fix is not a room-type branch — that would fork the static block and cost
the byte-stability it exists for. It is to say only what is true everywhere and
leave the room-specific fact to the room's own prompt, which is the only place
that knows.
