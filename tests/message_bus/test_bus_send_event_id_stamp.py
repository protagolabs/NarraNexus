@description: An agent's own bus send records WHICH turn produced it.

The team room's failure notice hangs on this. When the runtime declines to
deliver a turn but does not call it fatal, the trigger asks the room "did
anything from this agent land here during that turn?" — and answers it by
matching ``bus_messages.event_id`` against the turn's id. The platform's own
in-turn post stamps that id; so must the agent's own ``message_agent``, or
the question has an answer for one half of the deliveries and a guess for the
other, and the guess puts a "delivery failed" line in a room that has already
heard the agent speak.

Why this file exists SEPARATELY from the trigger-side tests: those stub
``_invoke_runtime`` and write the row themselves with ``event_id="evt_1"``,
i.e. they assume this stamping rather than verify it. The stamp rides an
identity HEADER (``caller_event_id_from_request``) whose documented behaviour
on absence is to return None silently — so every link of that chain can break
without a single test going red. This one goes through the registered tool.
