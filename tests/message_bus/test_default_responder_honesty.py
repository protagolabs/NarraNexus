@description: Telling an agent WHY it was woken, when nobody named it.

A team room is purely @mention-driven, so a user message that names nobody
would wake nobody. The route therefore picks the team's default responder —
correct, and the room would go silent without it. What it also did was write
that choice into the message's `mentions`, which made it indistinguishable from
the user actually typing that agent's name.

The turn prompt then told the agent "You were just @mentioned by User". It was
not. The difference matters to what the agent does next: being singled out by a
person is a reason to commit; being the room's fallback is a reason to check
whether someone else is the right owner and hand it over.

The fact is recorded where the choice is made — the trigger has no way to infer
it, and guessing ("one mention, and it happens to be the lead") cannot be told
apart from a user deliberately naming the lead, which is a common thing to do.

Pinned here:
  * a real @mention still reads as one
  * a routed message says so instead, and says why this agent got it
  * the routing itself is unchanged — exactly one agent still wakes
