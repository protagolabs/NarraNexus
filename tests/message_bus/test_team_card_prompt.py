@description: The team card — what a member is told about the team it is in.

A member woke up knowing its own name, that it was "in a team group chat", and
a comma-separated list of teammate names. Not what the team is called, not what
it exists to do. The owner fills in a description and an intro in the management
UI believing they are setting the team's terms; neither field had a single
consumer on the agent side, so the answer to "why are we all here" was never in
the room.

Pinned here:
  * the team's name and description ride the prompt
  * `intro_md` rides it too, bounded, and says so when it was cut
  * an unset field renders as nothing, never as an empty heading
  * the card sits ahead of the how-to-work sections — "where am I and with
    whom" is not a footnote to "here is the shared folder"
