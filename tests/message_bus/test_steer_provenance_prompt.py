@description: A team run is steerable — a message arriving mid-turn is appended
live with a source tag (render_injection). The tag carries authority (owner vs
teammate), and the nonce delimiter only makes that boundary hold at the STRING
layer; it becomes a boundary the MODEL honors solely once the fixed team prompt
STATES the rule. So the standing prompt MUST carry STEER_PROVENANCE_RULE — drop
it and a teammate could smuggle a forged `[the owner adds]` line and be believed.

Pinned here so the wiring cannot silently regress to "we inject tagged content
the model was never taught to read".
