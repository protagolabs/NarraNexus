@author:
@date: 2026-08-20
@description: The bus context carries a STANDING address book — the teams the
agent belongs to, with their ids — so `message_team(team_id=...)` has a target
on every turn, not only when a team room happens to sit in the unread window.

Capability follows the agent, not the trigger channel: an agent woken in a DM
must still be told the id of the team room it wants to post into. `Known Agents`
already carries peer ids; this pins that teams are carried the same way.

Covers all three layers, because a renderer test that supplies its own
`bus_teams` proves the renderer and says NOTHING about the fetch — and it is the
fetch that decides whether a DM turn can reach a room at all (the same trap
`test_room_labels_producer.py` was written to close):
  * `_team_address_book` — the PRODUCER, against a real database;
  * `hook_data_gathering` — the WIRING, membership → producer → extra_data;
  * `_volatile_context_parts` — the RENDERER.
