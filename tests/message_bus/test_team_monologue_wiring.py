@description: Locks the include_monologue wiring in MessageBusTrigger.

The team room is the only surface whose prompt promises the agent its
plain text is delivered (auto-posted to the room), so it is the only
branch that may opt into NexusPower monologue collection. This wiring
is a single kwarg with default False at BOTH ends — if a refactor drops
it, the room silently goes mute again (the #203 incident shape:
evt_238abc4b0b0c4dca had the full reply in final_output and zero rows
in bus_messages). These tests pin prompt promise and collection switch
together.
