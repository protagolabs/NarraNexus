@description: A packaged team arrives with its rules.

A bundle is how a team is handed to someone else. The bulletin is the team's
operating conventions, so a bundle that leaves it behind ships a team that has
forgotten how it works — and the recipient cannot know what was lost, because
the absence looks exactly like a team that never had any rules.

Two things are deliberately NOT carried, and both are asserted:

  * the auto-summary. It describes progress in the exporter's run, so in the
    recipient's install it is a confident description of work that never
    happened there. It regenerates on its own within minutes.
  * `author_id`. Both agent ids and the owner's user id are re-minted on
    import; a stale id would attribute a rule to whoever now holds that id, or
    to nobody. The bundle keeps the SOURCE (so an agent-written rule still
    reads as one) and drops the pointer.
