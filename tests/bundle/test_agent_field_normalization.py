@description: Import-time normalization of agent_name / agent_description.

The bundle importer raw-inserts the `agents` row, bypassing
`AgentRepository`, so it has to normalize at its own edge. A row that lands
holding " 小绿 " can never be cleaned up afterwards: `agent_field_matches`
compares normalized values, so the owner saving "小绿" is judged a no-op, no
write is issued, and the endpoint then certifies the untouched row —
success, no error, nothing logged. This path has no feature flag: bundle
import and team-marketplace install both reach it.

The ORDER is the contract, and it is what these tests exist for:

    normalize → dedupe → normalize + clamp again

- normalize BEFORE dedupe, or a name with stray whitespace fails to match the
  already-normalized row it is supposed to be deduped against.
- normalize AND clamp again AFTER dedupe, because the " (n)" suffix has
  neither a length budget nor a whitespace budget of its own: 255 chars
  becomes 259, and an empty candidate becomes " (1)" with a leading space.

Asserting only the final value would stay green with the normalize call moved
after dedupe, so `test_whitespace_name_dedupes_against_the_normalized_row`
uses the one input that can tell the two orders apart.

Sibling of test_agent_field_length.py (the clamp half); fixtures mirror it.
