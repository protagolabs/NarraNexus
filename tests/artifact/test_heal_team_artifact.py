@description: Recovering a broken pointer on a TEAM artifact.

Every step of heal was written when an artifact could only live in the
producing agent's workspace, and all three broke once team artifacts were
required to live in the team folder:

  1. the "pointer is already valid" shortcut compares against the workspace
     root, which a team artifact never satisfies — so an artifact whose file is
     perfectly fine is declared broken and the flow continues;
  2. the candidate scan walks that same workspace, so the modal offers the
     agent's own unrelated files for a team artifact;
  3. both re-registration paths omit team_id, so they hit the ownership check
     added with the reachability guard and fail with "artifact not found".

The net effect was a recovery flow that could not succeed: intact content
reported as broken, a candidate list drawn from the wrong directory, and every
choice ending in an error. This was cited in teams.py as the reason clear_files
must cascade — true, but a reason to fix the flow, not to leave it.
