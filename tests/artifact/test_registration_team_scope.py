@description: Registration learns about teams.

Three things change at the registration boundary:

1. **Ownership** — an artifact registered during a team turn belongs to that
   team, so it lands in the team workspace instead of one agent's private
   list. The team comes from the SERVER (identity headers), never from a tool
   argument, so a private turn cannot claim one.
2. **Where the file may live** — the entry had to sit inside the agent's own
   workspace, which made a file in the team shared folder impossible to
   register at all: the shared folder is a SIBLING of every agent workspace by
   design, so it was permanently out of bounds.
3. **Attribution** — every registration appends a history row, because
   re-registering overwrites the pointer in place and otherwise leaves no
   trace of who changed what.

`scope` exists only to let an agent opt OUT ("private") of a team turn's
default. It is a plain `str` with a default rather than `Optional[str]`:
FastMCP renders Optional as `anyOf:[X,null]`, which strict-schema providers
reject with a request-level 400 — a whole-request failure, not a degraded
call.
