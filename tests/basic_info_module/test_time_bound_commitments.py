@description: Lock the "a promise with a time on it must be scheduled" rule.

An agent that says "I'll let you know on Friday" has, as far as the runtime
is concerned, said nothing: no part of the system re-reads a reply at the
appointed moment. The commitment expires silently, and from the user's side
that reads as being ignored rather than as a missed reminder.

The rule therefore has to live in the always-loaded module (JobModule is
`module_type="task"` and is exactly the module that may NOT be loaded at the
moment the agent makes a promise), and it has to survive into BOTH prompt
layouts — the stable one and the legacy one.
