@description: The closure-rate maths behind "is a stronger fallback needed".

PR #230's standing position is that platform-side delivery fallback needs
measurement first. `latency-report` measures how FAST a hop is; nothing
measured whether the hand-off ever CLOSED. This report does, by reading the
`[work-item]` lines the errand layer writes.

The traps pinned here are the ones that make a diagnostic lie quietly rather
than fail loudly:

* a rate must never exceed 100%. An item closed inside the window but opened
  before it has no `open` line to pair with, so counting it as a close of a
  window-opened item inflates the numerator past the denominator.
* a stall is logged on the TRANSITION. Patrol re-derives `stalled` every
  sweep, so a per-sweep line would make one dead hand-off read as hundreds.
* origins are not mixed by default: a `tool` item is a TASK spanning several
  errands, so folding it into "closure rate" makes the number mean two things.
* the same LOCAL-time and `.zip` handling as the latency report — both fail as
  "no data", which reads as "the feature is not recording".
