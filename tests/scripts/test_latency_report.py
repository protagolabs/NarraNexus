@description: The percentile maths and log parsing behind PRD acceptance #1.

This report reads `[bus-timing]` / `[turn-timing]` straight out of
``~/.narranexus/logs``. It used to read two purpose-built tables; those were
dropped once it became clear the log files already carry the data AND are
already retained for 30 days (loguru: rotation="00:00", retention="30 days").
Adding two tables, two repositories and two hot-path writes bought a JOIN and
little else — see the mirror for the full reasoning.

Four things are pinned, all of which fail as "no data" rather than as an error,
which is the worst failure mode a diagnostic can have:

* the -1 sentinel is EXCLUDED, not read as zero. A hop whose message carried no
  `created_at` has no knowable queue wait; folding it in as 0ms reports the
  fastest hops we never had and can flip a FAIL into a PASS.
* percentiles are nearest-rank, so every number printed names a hop that really
  happened.
* log timestamps are LOCAL time (loguru's default) while the window is computed
  from `datetime.now()`. Mixing in a UTC cutoff silently drops several hours of
  the most recent data — the hours you actually care about.
* rotated logs are `.zip`. Reading only `*.log` sees today and nothing else,
  which quietly turns a 30-day report into a today-report.
