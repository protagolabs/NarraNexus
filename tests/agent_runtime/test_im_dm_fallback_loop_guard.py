@description: The DM fallback must not become a ping-pong engine.

``no_reply_im_dm`` writes a reply the agent never sent and delivers it on
the channel. Until now it asked exactly one question — "was a reply tool
called?" — and would happily invent a reply to another agent, forever.

``message_bus`` was excluded from the fallback from the start, with the
reasoning "must not answer peer agents". But agent-to-agent conversations
also arrive over IM channels: the 8/14 incident was two agents in a
NarraMessenger DM, which is precisely the path the exclusion did not
cover. These tests pin the two new gates.
