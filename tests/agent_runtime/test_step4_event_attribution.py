@description: A turn writes exactly ONE row into `events`, whatever the
              narrative-selection width.

Regression pin for the 0802 "对话时序错乱" report. Narrative selection returns
up to `MAX_NARRATIVES_IN_CONTEXT` (3) narratives — the head is the thread the
turn belongs to, the rest are BM25 neighbours pulled in only to enrich the
read-side context. Step 4.4 used to author a *copy* of the event into every
auxiliary narrative (`duplicate_event_for_narrative`), which produced 1-2
phantom rows per turn, stamped at the moment the run finished:
`state='completed'`, `started_at IS NULL`, `tool_call_count=0`, `event_log='[]'`
and the primary row's `final_output`. Replay surfaces that read the `events`
table then showed the same turn several times, positioned by the run's END
time — an already-answered question re-appearing below newer ones.

These tests drive the real step_4 against real SQLite and assert on the DB
rows, not on the step's own progress narration.
