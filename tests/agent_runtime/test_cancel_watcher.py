@description: CancelWatcher — the cross-process half of "stop this run".

Coverage targets:
  * a pending stop fires the token; no request leaves it alone
  * a stop older than the run does NOT fire (a fresh run must not inherit
    the previous one's flag)
  * a fired token is unregistered — one run is cancelled once
  * a DB failure never propagates to the watched run (binding rule #14:
    the platform is not the interruption source)
  * the poll task starts on first register and stops when nothing is watched
