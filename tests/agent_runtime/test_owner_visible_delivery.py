@description: "Delivered to whoever contacted you" and "visible in the
owner's web chat" are two different predicates, and the session anchor
must only follow the second.

PR #230 review finding: expanding the bus handler's
``user_reply_tool_names`` (the delivered-to-origin list) silently flowed
into ``step_4._turn_delivered_user_message``, whose contract is
owner-chat visibility — every agent-to-agent bus reply would re-anchor
the OWNER's session onto the bus errand's narrative and clear
``last_query``. These tests pin the split: the handler exposes an
owner-visible subset (``owner_visible_reply_tool_names``, defaulting to
the full reply list for handlers whose channel IS the owner's surface),
and step_4 consumes only that.

# extractor were separate copies of the same loop; a divergence between them

# quiet while its numbers still look healthy.

# The tests above pin the boolean reading. These pin the list reading, so the
# shared implementation is covered from both sides.

    The old loop returned True at the first hit and never touched what came

    raises on a LATER element sends the traversal into its `except` and the
    predicate reports False.

    That is the intended choice: "the response could not be read cleanly"
    resolves to "not delivered", which is the conservative side for both
    consumers — the session anchor stays put, the guard skips a turn. Pinned
    here so the next person does not "fix" the except into `return texts` to
    salvage the partial list; that is what would let the anchor and the guard
    actually disagree.

    Reaching the except needs the handler itself to raise (`resp.details` is
    already isinstance-guarded), so the handler is stubbed rather than the
    input malformed — otherwise this test would silently assert nothing, the
