@description: Capture what `run()` hands RunContext, without running a turn.

`AgentRuntime.run()` does real work before it builds the RunContext — resolve
the DB client, load the agent row, replace `user_id` with the owner, set the
cost context, construct services, resolve the turn profile. Every one of those
decisions reaches the rest of the turn through the RunContext kwargs and
nowhere else, which makes those kwargs the one place to assert them.

The seam: spy the module attribute `run()` resolves `RunContext` through, and
raise the moment the kwargs are in hand. No steps execute, no LLM is called,
and the assertion is about the real prologue rather than a re-implementation
of it.

Extracted here when the second copy appeared and the two had already diverged
(one stubbed the DB client, one did not). That prologue has taken two new
parameters in a month; a third copy would mean a third place to fix when it
takes another, and a test going red for reasons unrelated to what it tests.

    """Sentinel that ends the run once the kwargs are captured.

    BaseException is defensive, not currently load-bearing: the RunContext
    construction sits outside every `except Exception` in `run()`, so the
    sentinel propagates either way — downgrading this to Exception today does
    NOT turn any test red, which is exactly why the base class is worth
    stating rather than leaving to memory. It matters the moment the capture
    point moves inside one of those guarded blocks, where a swallowable
    sentinel would make every test built on this fixture pass without ever
    reaching its assertion.
