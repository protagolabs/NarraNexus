@description: /health's ``busy`` flag — the signal the broker's idle reaper
consults before stopping a container.

The broker only ever sees turn START, so its idle timer cannot tell a
multi-hour turn (binding rule #14: first-class) from an abandoned container.
This flag is what tells them apart, which makes two properties load-bearing:

  * it must be TRUE for the whole duration of a streaming turn, and
  * it must come back DOWN on every exit path, including the ones no route
    handler can observe — otherwise the container reports busy forever and
    stops being reapable at all.
