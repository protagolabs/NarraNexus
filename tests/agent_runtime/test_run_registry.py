@description: RunRegistry — the per-process index of live runs by
(agent_id, surface), so a producer can ask "is this agent already running
on THIS surface?" and steer into that run instead of dispatching a new
turn. Surface-scoping is the whole point: a message for one surface must
never route into the same agent's run on a different surface.

RunRegistry is deliberately synchronous (dict ops, no await between read
and write — that atomicity is the design), so these tests are plain ``def``:
no event loop, no ``@pytest.mark.asyncio`` (the project runs
``asyncio_mode = "auto"``, and writing them async would falsely suggest an
async API).
