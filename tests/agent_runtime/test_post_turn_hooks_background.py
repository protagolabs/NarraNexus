@description: Steps 5-6 run detached — the contract nobody had pinned.

PRD《Team 群聊响应速度》acceptance #3 is two claims, and only the first half
was ever asserted anywhere: "the reply does not wait for the post-turn hooks"
AND "the memory / social / narrative writes still complete correctly once they
run in the background". The second half has been load-bearing since 2026-05
and had no test at all.

What is pinned here:

* run() returns while a slow hook is still going (non-blocking, for real —
  measured against the hook, not against a sleep),
* the hook's writes land after ``drain_background_tasks()``,
* one module blowing up does not take the turn's already-delivered reply with
  it, and the failure is logged rather than swallowed,
* a credential-class failure reaches ``alert_background_llm_failure`` — the
  2026-07 incident where the platform key 401'd for two weeks in silence,
* the owner's helper-LLM credentials are re-injected into the detached task,
  which is the whole reason ``inject_owner_helper_credentials`` is called
  inside ``_run_hooks_background`` rather than inherited from run().

The harness stubs Steps 1-2.5 (narrative selection and module loading each
call helper LLMs; neither is what this file is about) and runs ``silent=True``
so Step 3 is skipped by the production code path rather than by a patch.
Steps 0 and 4 run for real against the in-memory sqlite, so the Event row the
hooks read is a real one.
