@description: Drives the IM DM recovery slot end to end, across the two
layers that have to agree for a silent turn to reach the person waiting.

Why this exists as an integration test rather than more unit tests: the
0802 failure was never a single wrong function. Every piece was
individually fine — the model produced text, the channel had a working
send tool, the persistence layer had a "delivered" concept — and the
person on WeChat still got nothing, because nothing connected them.

Three live Telegram turns (2026-08-06) could not exercise this path at
all: once the DM protocol was fixed, the model kept replying correctly,
so the fallback never fired. It cannot be reached by hand on demand, and
the one time its wiring was broken (an empty turn envelope made it dead
code) only a database read caught it. Hence a CI-side nail.

What is asserted, in one flow:
  1. helper_llm's text is DELIVERED through the channel's registered
     sender, with the channel's addressing kwargs intact;
  2. the synthetic frame is tagged with the CHANNEL's send tool, so
  3. `chat_module` classifies the turn as an IM reply delivered to the
     origin — and NOT as an owner-facing notification;
  4. nothing is recorded when the channel refuses the send;
  5. no AgentTextDelta frames leak into the owner's chat panel.
