@description: A team reply is a delivery, and the turn's books must say so.

## What this file used to be, and why most of it is gone (2026-08-17)

A team room used to be the one surface where the agent's PLAIN TEXT was the
reply and the platform posted it. The reply surface was emptied outright for
those turns, so no tool frame was reachable — the accounting was not merely
missing the reply, it was structurally incapable of seeing it, and every team
turn filed as "no reply sent" and started the next one cold. The fix at the time
moved delivery into the turn as a callback, and most of this file drove that
callback, its gate, and their wiring.

**The callback is gone.** A team reply is a `message_team` tool call now, like
every other surface's reply, so the accounting sees it the ordinary way and
there is no gate to test: nothing decides whether the platform may speak on the
agent's behalf, because it never does. Fourteen tests were removed for that
reason and no other — their subject stopped existing. Each was checked
individually against "what does this guard, and does that thing still exist?"
before it went.

## What still holds, and is still pinned here

  * **`message_team` / `message_agent` count as delivered but NOT as
    owner-visible.** This survived the redesign unchanged and is the
    load-bearing one: without it, every agent-to-agent reply re-anchors the
    owner's chat session — a bug this repo has already fixed once, and one the
    cold-start work depends on staying fixed.
  * **What counts as a fatal turn** (`RunCollection.is_fatal` and the
    collector's sticky-fatal rule). Unrelated to team delivery; it gates the
    helper-LLM fallback and is consulted every turn.

    work planned on top of this depends on it holding.
