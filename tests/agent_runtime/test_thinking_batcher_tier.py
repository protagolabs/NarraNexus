@description: The batcher must never coalesce across a tier switch.

Why this exists — reproduced live on 2026-08-30, DeepSeek-V4-Pro through
nexus_power. The batcher flushes on ~100 ms / 500 chars and, before this,
only on non-thinking events; a monologue/CoT switch did NOT flush. So the
batch straddling that switch carried CoT plus the first characters of the
narration, and the frontend's tier rule (subset == whole) called it CoT:

    frame 41  content = "...Silence is correct here." + "There"   monologue = "There"
    frame 42  content = "'s no new user message in this turn..."  (pure)

frame 41 rendered receded, frame 42 as narration — one sentence torn at
"There" | "'s no new user message", mid-word, at whatever byte the 100 ms
window happened to land on.

A tier switch is now a flush, so every emitted batch is tier-PURE and a
boundary can only fall where the tier genuinely changed — never inside a
content frame.

Iron rule #16: this must not cost the coalescing it exists for. A stream
that never switches tier flushes exactly as it did before; the only extra
batches are at real transitions. Pinned below.
