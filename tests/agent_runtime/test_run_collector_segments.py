@description: Keeping the monologue/reply boundary that the room needs to read.

In a team room the agent's own thinking is streamed as `AGENT_THINKING` with a
`monologue` payload, and its answer as `AGENT_RESPONSE` deltas. The collector
appended both to one list and joined it, so what reached the wall was a single
markdown blob with the boundary gone.

That is why "reuse the private chat's segmentTurn" cannot work: segmentTurn cuts
a turn using the EVENT STREAM, and by the time a team message exists the event
stream has been flattened away. No frontend heuristic can recover it — it can
only guess, and guessing wrong renders deliberation as conclusion or the reverse.

So the boundary is preserved here, at the one place that still has it.

The most important test in this file is the LAST one: every non-team turn in the
product goes through this same function, and its output must not move by a
single byte.
