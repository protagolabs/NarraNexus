@description: Every surface, both halves: what the desk holds and what the
              turn's opening line says about it.

Spec §10 item 2. Two independent mechanisms decide what an agent is told to do
this turn:

  * the DESK — `get_expressive_tools` names the turn's reply tool, and
    `get_disallowed_tools` removes the other candidates' schemas;
  * the DECLARATION — `render_origin_declaration` writes the `[Origin] … reply
    with …` line at the top of the turn.

They are built from the same tuple by design, so they cannot disagree in
principle. In practice the platform shipped with them disagreeing on EVERY team
turn, because the runtime asks for suppression before declaration and one module
was reading the turn from state the declaration had not written yet. Both hooks
were individually correct; nothing looked at a whole surface at once. That is
what this file does, and it is per-surface rather than a single case because the
bug was surface-specific — peer DMs were fine throughout.

Each row asserts three things that together mean "this turn is answerable":
  1. something is declared (a surface with no reply tool cannot answer);
  2. nothing declared is also suppressed (the reminder names a callable tool);
  3. the opening line exists and names the declared default (so prose and desk
     tell one story) — except where the surface deliberately has no reply tool,
     which must produce NO line rather than an invented one.
