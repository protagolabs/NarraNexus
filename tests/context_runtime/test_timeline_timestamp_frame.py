@date: 2026-08-18
@description: Lock the timezone frame of chat-history timeline tags.

The defect: `meta_data.timestamp` is written by every producer as
`utc_now().isoformat()`, and `_format_timeline_tag` rendered it with a raw
`ts[:16]` string slice. The frame was therefore dropped on the floor, while
the SAME prompt carried "Real World Information" as the user's local wall
clock WITH a `+08:00`-style offset.

For a user at +08:00 that means every message sent between local 00:00 and
08:00 was tagged with the previous calendar day. An agent asked to resolve
"下周五" against a message it believes was sent on Thursday (it was Friday)
lands a week's plan on the wrong date, and a date that has already passed
still reads as upcoming. That is the reported failure mode.

Contract locked here:
  1. Timeline timestamps are converted to the user's timezone.
  2. They always carry an explicit UTC offset.
  3. That offset matches the one on the ground-truth "now", so the two are
     directly comparable.
  4. A missing/garbage timestamp degrades to "??" and never raises.
