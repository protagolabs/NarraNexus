@description: Reply-language system-prompt directive.

Policy history: the 2026-08-11 fix made the UI language a HARD output
constraint ("write every reply in {name}") — the Shenzhen round-2 retest
(manual checklist B4) showed the inversion it causes: UI set to Chinese,
English questions answered in Chinese. Owner decision 2026-08-20, a
three-level priority pinned here: an explicit language request in the
message wins, then the CURRENT message's own language, then the configured
preference as the undeterminable-language fallback. Byte-stability keeps
the section in the cacheable prompt region.

    protected this branch; deleting it silently was the regression this
