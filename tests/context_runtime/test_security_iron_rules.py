@description: The platform-wide security iron rules must exist and be
injected FIRST into every agent's system prompt.

Incident 2026-06-17: an agent dumped all backend env vars and read
another agent's workspace on request. SECURITY_IRON_RULES is the
prompt-layer mitigation; these tests lock its content + placement.
