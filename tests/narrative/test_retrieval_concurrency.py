@description: Overlapping two reads must not change which narrative is chosen.

`_retrieve_top_k` used to do three awaits in a row: ensure_defaults,
participant_query, load_pool. The last two are independent and now overlap.

The saving is single-digit milliseconds against a setup phase whose p50 is 8.5
seconds — this is emphatically not a latency fix, and the file says so where it
matters. What it IS is a change to the highest-consequence surface in the
codebase, so the property that matters is that it changed nothing:

* ensure_defaults still runs to completion BEFORE the pool is read. It CREATES
  default narratives when missing; a pool read racing that creation would drop
  them from the BM25 candidate set — a wrong answer, not a slow one.
* both reads still happen, and both results still reach the candidate pool.
* a failure in either is still raised, not swallowed into a half-built pool.
