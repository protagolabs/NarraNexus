@description: The routing audit must be sufficient for EXACT offline replay.

Why this file exists
====================
Narrative routing decisions were previously written only to a ProgressMessage
and loguru — nothing reached the database (incident lesson #5: docker logs
rotate, a grep only finds what you thought to search for). With no persisted
decision there is no denominator, so "we improved routing accuracy by X%" had
nothing to measure against.

The trap this pins down is subtler than "we forgot to log it". A naive audit
that stores only narrative IDs and scores CANNOT be replayed, because
``bm25_rank`` computes IDF *and* avgdl over the candidate set it is handed —
so the score of a candidate depends on every other document in the pool, and
on the exact ``current_summary`` / ``topic_keywords`` text each carried AT
DECISION TIME. Those fields are rewritten wholesale by the async LLM updater
on (almost) every turn and keep no history, so re-reading `narratives` later
reconstructs a pool that never existed.

Hence: the audit stores the WHOLE pool as content-addressed text snapshots.
`test_audit_replays_bm25_exactly` is the property that makes the table worth
its bytes — it fails if anyone trims the pool to top-K or drops the text.
