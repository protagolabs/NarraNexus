@description: `narrative_info.description` is a birth certificate, not a
medical record: it may be read ONLY while `current_summary` is still empty.

THE DEFECT (prod, whole `narratives` table, 2026-08-20)

`description` is written once at creation from the raw triggering input, is
never rewritten by the updater, and yet it is in `searchable_text()` — i.e. in
the BM25 index — and in the continuity prompt. A thread born on a 5KB scheduled
task prompt therefore has that 5KB welded into its retrieval surface forever.

Magnitude, measured on all 1,381 non-default prod narratives (NOT the 146-row
"chosen lines" fetch, which understated the tail by ~8x):

    description length   0 | 1-200 | 201-512 | 513-1500 | 1501-6000 | >6000
    narratives         259 |   675 |      80 |       76 |       216 |    75
                                                          -------------------
                                                          291 = 21.1% > 1500

`max = 198,398 characters`. Total description text in the index: 2.57 MB.

Why 21% matters more than it sounds: BM25 computes IDF and avgdl over the
candidate pool ITSELF, so one 6KB document both raises avgdl (crushing every
normal document's length normalisation) and hands itself a large pool of
matchable tokens. Offline re-scoring of the two PR②-v2 arms (630 scorable
decisions, byte-exact replay) shows the bypass rate for sequences containing a
bloated thread at **41.0%** against **14.5%** for those without — a 3.7x effect
that swamped the arm-level measurement it was supposed to serve.

THE RULE

    description is read ONLY while current_summary is empty.

Full retirement once the summary exists, not truncate-and-keep-reading. The
condition is on the summary rather than on "the updater has run" because the
updater is async and can fail: a thread born during a helper outage never gets
a summary. A conditional rule self-heals — record written, birth certificate
retires; record stillborn, birth certificate keeps standing in so the thread
does not go invisible. Prod today: 191 non-default threads have no summary, and
all 191 also have an empty description, so the safety branch currently protects
nobody — it is a net, not a load-bearing path. Meanwhile all 291 bloated
threads DO have a summary, so the rule retires 100% of the bloat.

Dry run before implementing (`tools/description_retirement_dryrun.py`):

    variant        bloat-group bypass   max top1   gold rows made unretrievable
    (today)                     41.0%      548.9   -
    retirement                   8.8%      152.6   19
    truncate 512                15.3%      252.1   0
    truncate 200                12.8%      204.1   0

All 19 were fossil-only hits: with the description removed the thread matched
ZERO query terms, 15 of the 19 scored below RAW_FLOOR to begin with (0.29-1.39,
a single incidental character like `好` / `叫` / `you`), and the ones the live
decision actually landed on landed via `no_topic_anchored`, i.e. the session
anchor, not the BM25 menu. One class is genuine and named in the report: a
thread whose summary has drifted away from its founding question loses that
founding question as a retrieval signal (`p05:18`).
