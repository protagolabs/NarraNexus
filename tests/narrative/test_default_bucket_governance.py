@description: RED-first tests for the default-bucket governance P0 batch.

The batch is four changes that only make sense together (spec
`2026-08-14-default-bucket-governance-design.md`):

  4  default narratives stop being routing CONTAINERS (out of the BM25 pool,
     out of the judge's candidate menu, no longer seeded). The eight category
     names were initially kept as prompt VOCABULARY; 2026-08-21 live testing
     showed the taxonomy teaching classify-and-dump, so they are gone from
     every prompt (see test_judge_instructions_dropped_the_eight_category_names).
  4' the "no durable topic" verdict lands anchor-first: reuse the session's
     real thread without touching its retrieval surface; create when there is
     no anchor. (A third ephemeral/run-bare branch was removed on review
     2026-08-21 — unreachable in production; see _land_no_topic_turn.)
  5  continuity may never hold a turn on a default bucket.
  C2 the continuity prompt stops deciding by container type.

Every assertion here is about behaviour a user or an audit row can observe,
not about internal call shapes — a rewrite of the impl that keeps these
green is a rewrite we want to allow.
