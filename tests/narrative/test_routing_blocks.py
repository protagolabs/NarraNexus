@description: The four shared routing prompt blocks render exactly what the
continuity tier and the judge rendered before they were shared.

WHY BYTE-IDENTITY IS THE CONTRACT

Three tiers describe the same four things to a model — the anchored thread, the
previous turn, the BM25 menu, the PARTICIPANT threads — and every time one of
those descriptions was copied instead of shared, the copies drifted and only one
got fixed:

  * the judge's search branch and its PARTICIPANT branch were two
    implementations of "what a candidate shows the model"; on 2026-04-15 only
    the search branch moved onto the live `narrative_info` fields, and the other
    spent two months labelling 72-event threads by a frozen creation-time hint;
  * the two judge prompt variants forked THREE times over the no-topic rubric,
    the last caught in PR #361 review round 2.

So the blocks were extracted into `routing_blocks.py`. But both prompts are
pinned by MEASURED numbers — M6 = 20.8%, the P1 calibration, the
description-retirement dry run — and a whitespace change would quietly
invalidate every one of them. Hence these are golden-string tests, transcribed
from the pre-extraction source: they fail if the shared block renders so much as
a different newline.

The `include_score` / `summary_max_chars` / `include_bucket_note` parameters
exist for the merged router, and each defaults to the old behaviour. This file
asserts the DEFAULTS; `test_merged_routing_prompt.py` asserts the overrides.
