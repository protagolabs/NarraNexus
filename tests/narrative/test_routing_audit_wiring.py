@description: `NarrativeService.select()` must actually emit an audit row.

`test_routing_audit.py` proves the audit record is replay-sufficient. It says
nothing about whether production ever writes one — and a table that is correct
but unwritten is exactly the state narrative routing was already in (the
decision existed only in a ProgressMessage and loguru).

The continuity branch gets its own test because it is the path with no BM25
pool and no gate, so it is the one an "audit lives in the retrieval tier"
implementation would silently skip — while being the branch that most needs a
trail: a false `is_continuous` re-uses `session.current_narrative_id` with no
topic check, and each turn writes that id straight back.
