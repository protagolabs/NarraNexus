@date: 2026-08-20
@description: The channel routing prefix "[From <name>]" must not be BM25
evidence, and must never end up inside a narrative's name.

WHY (prod, 2026-08-14..20, 26,922 routing-audit rows)

96% of prod queries arrive as ``[From <name>] <body>`` — `build_channel_anchor`
puts the sender there on purpose, so the judge and the continuity tier can see
who is talking. BM25 then scores those two tokens like topic evidence:

  tokenize('[From Liam] 👊')  ->  ['from', 'liam']      # the emoji tokenises to nothing

Audit row 768 is that query, scored 5.66 — **100% of it from `from`+`liam`**
(51% / 49%) — which cleared RAW_FLOOR=3.0. Across the whole probe, 30.5% of
prefix-carrying decisions drop to a top1 of ZERO once the prefix is removed:
the routing metadata WAS the entire match.

And it is self-reinforcing. `create_from_query` names a new narrative after the
query and `updater._apply_llm_update` lets the helper LLM rewrite that name from
event text, so prod now carries narratives literally called
``[From U082541Q6AX] stop gre...`` / ``[From o9cq8001z5NQ4n4H2VdvK...`` /
``[From Liam] * 👊 刚甩过去...``. Every later message from that channel matches
its own line's name on the prefix, at a low in-pool df — audit row 1492 reached
margin **357.79** and skipped the judge entirely. The prefix builds the magnet
and then flies into it.

Scope note: only the LEADING prefix is stripped. `message_bus` joins several
messages, each line prefixed, and those interior prefixes are ~1% of a 250-term
bus query whose evidence is broad and healthy (max-term share p50 0.03). Widening
the strip there would lower correct scores for no measured gain — see
`specs/2026-08-20-bm25-gate-redesign-research.md` §R2.1.
