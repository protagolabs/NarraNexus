@description: Narrative selection records WHERE its seconds went, per decision.

`[TIMED] narrative.*` has split narrative selection into six spans for a while
— into loguru only. `turn_timing.setup_ms` (2026-08-14) says the setup phase is
the largest single block of a turn, but not which tier inside it, and the log
lines that would say cannot be aggregated and do not survive a restart
(incident lesson #5).

`narrative_routing_audit` already writes one row per decision with the full
evidence trail. Four millisecond columns join the cost to the decision it paid
for, which is the question worth asking: not "how slow is narrative selection"
but "how slow is it WHEN IT SHORT-CIRCUITS vs when it calls the judge".

Pinned here:

* the four spans land as integer milliseconds on the audit row,
* a short-circuited decision records no judge cost — a NULL that means "did not
  run", not a zero that would drag the judge's average toward nothing,
* continuity that never ran leaves NULL for the same reason,
* the columns are advisory: a timing failure never disturbs the routing result.
