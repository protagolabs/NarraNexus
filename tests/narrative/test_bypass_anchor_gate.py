@date: 2026-08-20
@description: Skipping the LLM judge requires that the turn is STAYING PUT —
BM25's top-1 must be the thread the session is already anchored to.

WHY (prod, 2026-08-14..20, 26,922 routing-audit rows replayed byte-exact)

The floor+margin gate cannot be made right by tuning, because both numbers are
sums over a per-pool IDF table estimated on 9–100 documents:

  `[From Liam] 👊`, same agent, same text, 99 turns — top1 by pool size:
      19 -> 5.66   26 -> 3.35   34 -> 2.41   67 -> 1.09   100 -> 0.02
  RAW_FLOOR=3.0 flips somewhere between pool 26 and pool 34. Per-term
  contribution swings just as hard (2.89 -> 0.01), so "gate on the strongest
  term instead of the sum" inherits the same defect.

But the RISK is not spread across those numbers at all. Classifying every prod
exemption by what it did:

  | staying in the anchored thread | 9,229 | 92.5% |
  | switching to another thread    |   353 |  3.5% |
  | no anchor at all (first turn)  |   392 |  3.9% |

Hijacking can only come from the last two. B-7 p07 is the shape: one wrong
verdict put 20 of 22 turns into a stranger's thread, and the updater then
rewrote that thread's identity until the BM25 evidence was "correct".

So the necessary condition for skipping review becomes structural rather than
numeric: **a bypass may only keep a turn where it already was.** It reads no
score, so it cannot drift with pool size or query length — the one candidate
design in the study with zero cross-pool verdict flips.

The floor and margin conditions STAY, unchanged. Removing the margin (57.1%
balanced accuracy, and a lone scoring candidate gets margin=∞ by construction —
the weakest evidence scoring the highest) would LOOSEN the gate, and loosening
needs the real-pool arm. This batch moves the decision in one direction only:
strictly fewer bypasses than before, with no constant retuned.

SCOPE: `is_user_chat=True` only. `narrative_service.select` deliberately does
not advance `session.current_narrative_id` on background triggers, so cron jobs
and message-bus pings have no anchor by design — 388 of the 392 "no anchor"
exemptions are exactly those. Denying them would push a block of correct, broad-
evidence routings (max-term share p50 0.03, prod §R2.1) into the judge's
`no_topic` exit, which is a known-unfixed residual dump (R7 §7.3) and would risk
fragmentation with no arm to catch it. Background keeps the old rule and records
`background_scope` so prod accumulates the data for that decision.
