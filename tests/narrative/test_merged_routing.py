@description: One routing decision per turn instead of two — the flow, the
zero-LLM shutter, the landings, and the failure floor.

WHAT THIS BATCH CHANGES (specs/2026-08-25-merged-routing-design.md §3)

Today a turn can pay for TWO serial helper calls: continuity ("does this
continue the thread?") and, if that says no, the judge ("then where does it
go?"). Measured on prod (7 days, n=189 real user turns): 43 turns pay both, at
a serial p50 of 8,924ms. The non-LLM half of routing is 47.6ms mean — there is
nothing else in there to fix.

Merged routing runs BM25 FIRST on every turn, then either
  * opens a zero-LLM shutter (top1 IS the anchor, floor+margin clear) — this is
    `evaluate_bypass`'s existing `anchor_match` verdict, moved ahead of
    continuity rather than re-invented, or
  * asks ONE question with four answers: continue_anchor / match(i) / new /
    no_topic (plus `participant`, which stays exactly as structural as it is
    today).

THE DECIDER CHANGES; THE EXECUTORS DO NOT

Every landing below is an existing code path: the continuity landing, the
judge's search landing, `create_from_query`, `_land_no_topic_turn`. That is the
property that makes this reviewable — and `test_downstream_cannot_tell_who_
decided` is the assertion that step_1 / step_4 never learn there was a change.

THE FAILURE FLOOR (rule 6)

A merged call that raises, times out, or answers off-contract must NOT be read
as "new topic". Two production incidents (D19) were exactly this shape: a
failure in the deciding tier fell through to creation, the created thread became
the anchor, and the updater then rewrote it until the lexical evidence agreed.
So: anchor present → stay on it, flagged `merged_fallback_anchor`; no anchor →
creation is allowed but is flagged too. Never silent, never a switch.
