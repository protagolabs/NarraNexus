@description: The merged routing prompt's input contract — the iron rules that
are decided at PROMPT-CONSTRUCTION time, plus the read-side input budget.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (specs/2026-08-25-merged-routing-design.md §3.2)

Today a continuity turn returns BEFORE the retrieval tier, so the BM25 menu is
never built and a foreign thread has no way into any prompt. Merging the two
calls opens that door on every turn, and the measurement behind §3.2 says what
walks through it: on continuity turns the anchor thread is **not in the BM25
top-3 in 26.2%-71.6% of turns**, and the menu's first row is a foreign thread in
26.4%-93.8%. The p07 hijack specimen was caught, turn after turn, by exactly the
defence merging removes (`pool=0`, BM25 never ran).

So the anchor's presence in the prompt cannot be a consequence of its score.
It is rendered unconditionally, in its own section, deduplicated against the
menu — a data-forced structural constraint, not a style choice. Each rule below
is one of those constraints, asserted at the level where it is decided.

THE INPUT BUDGET (read-side only)

Every cap here clamps what the PROMPT shows, never what is stored: the same
`Narrative` row, the same `Session`, the same message. Head-preserving on
purpose — the referent of a follow-up ("讲第一个" / "the first one") lives at the
START of the agent's previous reply, so a tail-preserving clamp would drop the
very thing the merged call needs the previous turn for. Every clamp reports
itself into the audit row; a silently shortened prompt is one nobody can explain
later.
