@description: `select()` actually FILLS continuity_ms / retrieve_ms.

Reviewed gap. `test_routing_audit_timing.py` proves "a RoutingAudit carrying
these values reaches the table"; every one of its cases hands the values in by
hand. Nothing ran the real assignment. Delete either line in
`NarrativeService.select` and the whole backend suite stays green while two
columns sit permanently NULL.

That failure is unusually quiet: NULL is the schema's "this tier did not run",
so a broken recorder is indistinguishable from a decision that legitimately
skipped the tier. It surfaces only when somebody opens the audit table to ask
where the seconds went — which is the one job these columns have.

`is not None`, never `> 0`: a stubbed detector can finish inside one
millisecond and `int(...*1000)` legitimately yields 0, which in this schema
means "ran, was fast".
