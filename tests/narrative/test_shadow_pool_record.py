@date: 2026-08-25
@description: A continuity turn must record the BM25 pool it never consulted —
and must decide exactly what it decided before.

WHY (reference/self_notebook/specs/2026-08-25-merged-routing-design.md §2)

The zero-LLM shutter's releasable population is bounded at 6% (lower) to 39%
(upper) of continuity turns — a 3x band that is almost entirely reconstruction
slack, not signal. The band exists for one reason: when continuity says yes,
`NarrativeService.select` returns before the retrieval tier runs, so BM25 never
scores and the audit row carries no pool. Every estimate of "what would the
shutter have said here" is therefore inferred from a pool that was never built.

Slice 0 closes that by running the pool build on continuity turns too, purely
to RECORD it. Nothing about the verdict changes: the turn still lands on
`session.current_narrative_id`, still reports `selection_method="continuous"`.

THE INVARIANT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR

An instrument that changes the thing it measures is worse than no instrument.
`test_the_verdict_is_byte_identical_with_and_without_the_recorder` pins the
decision fields against the recorder being disabled, so a future edit that lets
the shadow pool leak into the outcome turns red here rather than in an arm.

COLUMN SEMANTICS (binding rule #6 — no silent meaning changes)

`gate_short_circuit` means "this turn skipped the judge because the gate said
so". On a shadow row NOTHING was decided by the gate, so it stays NULL exactly
as it is today. The hypothetical verdict goes into `bypass_score_gate` /
`bypass_reason`, which are this batch's own columns and have no legacy readers,
and `pool_is_shadow` marks the row so no aggregate mixes the two populations.
