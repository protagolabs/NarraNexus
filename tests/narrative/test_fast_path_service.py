@description: Real-service locks for the fast-path narrative primitives.

The step-level tests all inject AsyncMocks, which is how the small-corpus
fragmentation bug slipped through review. These run the REAL
NarrativeService against the isolated test DB and lock:

* create_fast persists a loadable narrative carrying the BM25 routing
  surface (title from the query, keywords, topic hint).
* The small-corpus regime is real: right after creation, the verbatim
  same query can still miss select_fast (BM25 IDF is degenerate on a
  tiny corpus) — which is exactly why step_1_fast_select must reuse the
  session thread instead of creating again (locked at the step level in
  test_step_1_fast_select.py).
