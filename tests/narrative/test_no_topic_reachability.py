@description: The "no durable topic" verdict must be REACHABLE and its landing
              must be CALLABLE. Both were neither, and the first test suite
              missed both because it stubbed the wrong boundary.

Live probe on 2026-08-16 (real DB, real helper LLM, agent_d8795abf5021) found:

  A. An empty candidate pool short-circuited `llm_judge_unified` before the
     model was ever asked, so `matched_type` came back None rather than
     "no_topic" and the landing rule never ran. A bare "哈哈哈" therefore
     OPENED A NEW THREAD while the session held a perfectly good anchor —
     precisely the fragmentation plan 4-A' exists to prevent — and an
     ephemeral (voice) turn created a narrative, breaking its no-trace
     contract. The early return was dead code while eight default buckets
     were always in the menu; removing them from the menu ACTIVATED it.

  B. `_land_no_topic_turn` called `create_from_query` without the required
     `narrative_type`, so the create branch raised TypeError on every real
     turn that reached it.

Why the first suite passed anyway, and what these tests do differently:

  * it stubbed `_llm_judge_unified` — OUR function — so the early return
    inside it was never executed. Here we stub `get_helper_sdk`, i.e. the
    network edge, and let the real judge code run.
  * it hand-wrote a `create_from_query` double with the wrong signature,
    turning the bug into the fixture's definition of correct. Here the double
    is `create_autospec`'d from the real method, so a mis-shaped call fails.

The rule this encodes: stub the boundary you do not own, never the logic
under test.
