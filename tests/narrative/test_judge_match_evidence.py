@description: The judge must see WHICH text matched, not just a squashed score.

Why this file exists
====================
The LLM arbitration tier (`llm_judge_unified`) is the only semantic check in
narrative routing, and it runs precisely on the turns the numeric gate refused
to decide — i.e. when candidates are CROWDED. Yet all it was handed per
candidate was `Similarity score: 0.91`, a number that is actively misleading:
a real local query ("帮我查一下明天上海的天气怎么样") scored 10.67 raw against an
unrelated meeting-notes narrative with 100% of that score coming from the
request-frame characters 查/天/下/一/帮 — the topic-bearing 明/上/海/气/样
contributed exactly zero. Squashed to 0.914, that reads as "91% confident".

The rendering side of the fix has existed since 2026-03-06 (`if
candidate.get('matched_content')` in `_retrieval_llm.py`), but the write side
was deleted on 2026-04-15 with the read side sitting in a different file — so
the branch has been dead ~4 months and `logger.debug("has no matched_content")`
fired every single turn. The alarm was ringing; nobody was listening.

What is locked here
===================
1. `bm25_explain` decomposes a score into per-term contributions whose SUM is
   the `bm25_rank` score — the anti-drift property. Two independent copies of
   the BM25 arithmetic is how the original bug class started, so the explain
   path must be the same arithmetic, not a re-derivation.
2. Ranked evidence reaches the search candidates (`matched_content`) and is
   rendered into the judge prompt (`Matched content:`).
3. PARTICIPANT candidates are labelled from LIVE fields. That branch read
   `topic_hint` — written once at creation and frozen since the 2026-06-09
   unified-memory refactor (84% empty on the local dev DB) — while the search
   branch 50 lines above read `narrative_info`. Both branches now go through
   ONE function, because "make them agree" without making them physically
   share code is what drifted the first time.
4. The dead single-match cluster is gone by name.
