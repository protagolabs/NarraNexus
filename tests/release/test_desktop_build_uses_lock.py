@description: The DMG's Python install must come from uv.lock, and the build
              must import what it packaged before shipping it.

2026-09-10 incident. Step 3 of build-desktop.sh was `uv pip install
"$PROJECT_ROOT"`, which RE-RESOLVES every dependency from the ranges in
pyproject.toml and ignores uv.lock. The dmg therefore shipped whatever PyPI
held on build day: 99 of the 176 resolved packages differed from the lock, and
one of them — `mcp` 2.2.0 against a locked 1.24.0 — had renamed
`streamablehttp_client` to `streamable_http_client`. Every sidecar service in
the shipped app died at import; the user saw "SQLite Proxy failed to start".

Two things had to be true for that to reach a user, and this file guards both:

  1. the install path bypassed the lock            → `test_step3_*`
  2. the build never imported the code it packaged → `test_import_smoke_*`

Same "mirror a fact + assert they agree" shape as test_plugins_extra_lockstep.py
(which guards a different property of the same step: that it stays uv-driven and
light). Cheap, and both fail on a plain `git revert` of the fix.
