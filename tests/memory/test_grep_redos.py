@description: grep_filter's regex path must be ReDoS-safe — the pattern is
agent/LLM-supplied and, once grep is served over HTTP, an unbounded match would
wedge the shared API loop. grep_filter returns (hits, truncated); these pin:
(1) an adversarial pattern returns bounded AND flags truncation; (2) a passed
deadline is honoured; (3) normal regex + substring + invalid-regex fallback work
and report truncated=False.
