@description: The cross-channel reachability flow (PR-2): the social graph is
the single home for "who I know and how to reach them", and the instruction
that turns that data into action must survive edits.

Two halves:
  * C2 — `get_contact_info` / `format_contact_result` RETURN the reach
    (`contact_info.channels`), so an agent can search out where to reach X.
  * WS-D — the module prompt teaches the flow (search → read channels → send on
    that channel), and says so in a way that stays true: capability follows the
    agent, reach is recorded automatically, and an absent channel means "no
    recorded way", not a guessed id.
