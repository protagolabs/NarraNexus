@description: When a contact's persona is worth re-inferring.

`should_update_persona` is the gate in front of an LLM call, so both of its
answers cost something real: a false "yes" burns a model round-trip on every
turn, a false "no" leaves the agent talking to who the contact used to be.

Ported from `src/.../social_network_module/test_persona.py`, a hand-run demo
script that pytest collected but `make test` never ran (it only runs `tests/`).
It had been asserting against `SocialNetworkModule._should_update_persona` —
a method that moved into `_entity_updater` long ago — so it could only ever
fail. The pure-logic half is worth keeping and lives here; the rest of that
script needed a live LLM key and a live database and was a demo, not a test.
