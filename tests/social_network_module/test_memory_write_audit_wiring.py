@description: The CALLER-side memory-write failures leave audit rows too.

`_entity_updater`'s own eight handlers are covered by
`test_entity_updater_alerts.py`. But memory writing does not only happen in
that file: `social_network_module` creates the primary entity and every
mentioned third-party entity itself, and those failures used to be
log-only — invisible to the `agent_runtime` alert layer because the hook
swallows at its outer edge.

Those two reporting call sites shipped without tests, which is the same
"new glue, zero coverage" gap this PR had already been sent back for one
layer down. Hence this file.

**Patch target matters.** `social_network_module.py` imports
`_report_write_failure` at module top level, so it holds a BOUND reference:
`monkeypatch.setattr(_entity_updater, "_report_write_failure", ...)` — what
the sibling test file does — has no effect here and would leave the
assertions silently passing against an empty list. Patch the attribute on
`social_network_module` instead.
