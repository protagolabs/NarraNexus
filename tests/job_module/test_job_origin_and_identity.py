@description: A job created in a team room reports back INTO that room, under
              the owner's real identity.

Two defects with one cause: a job remembered WHAT to do and forgot WHERE it was
asked.

**The reply surface.** `job_module` registers exactly one reply tool
(`send_message_to_user_directly`) and the execution prompt hard-codes "the
owner will see it when they open this conversation". So "@Leader remind us
tomorrow morning" — asked in a team room, in front of four people — delivered
into the owner's private chat. The room that asked never heard back. This is
PR #230's "the reply follows where it came from" applied to the job surface.

**The identity.** A bus turn runs with `user_id = sender_agent_id`
(`message_bus_trigger._invoke_runtime`), because on that surface "the user
whose request this is" is a peer. That value reached `job.user_id`, so a job
asked for in a team room was filed under `usr_<uid>` or a peer's `agent_id` —
an owner that does not exist. The owner's Jobs list stayed empty while the
agent reported success.

`_mcp_identity.resolve_caller_user_id` deliberately does NOT fix this: it
overrides placeholders only, and its comment says a mismatching REAL value can
be legitimate in multi-user flows. That judgement is about the generic identity
path and is left alone. A job's owner is a narrower question with a ground
truth — `agents.created_by` — so it is answered at the write site.

The regression half matters as much: a job asked for in private chat must
behave exactly as before, both in where it reports and in whose name it runs
(PRD acceptance #8).
