@description: The origin line survives the trip from step_3 to both drivers.

Rendering it correctly is worth nothing if it never reaches the model. Two
frameworks consume it (the Claude CLI adapter appends it to the turn's user
message; NexusPower puts it in the dynamic tail), and they must emit the SAME
characters — which is why neither one composes the sentence: they are handed a
finished string.

The failure this guards is quiet in the worst way. A dropped kwarg produces a
turn that runs fine, answers fine, and simply never told the agent where it
was — you would only find it by reading a prompt dump.

    its plain text — otherwise origin-first ordering presents some other module's
    tool as the way to answer, and on patrol that means telling the lead to message
    its owner instead of writing the room's status line.

    `test_surface_matrix.py` re-derives that flag inside the test and comments "the
    same three inputs step_3 composes it from" — so nothing asserted that step_3
    reads it from the right place. This is exactly the failure shape this file's
    own docstring describes: a dropped or misspelled kwarg produces a turn that
    runs fine and quietly loses the guarantee.

    run, and the property under test is which dict the value comes from, not what
    the model then does with it. `trigger_extra_data` is what
    `MessageBusTrigger._invoke_runtime` stamps and what `agent_runtime` carries
    onto the context; reading `ctx.extra_data` — which `RunContext` does not even
    have — was the first version of this line and pyright caught it.
