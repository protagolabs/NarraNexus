@description: Unit tests for classify_self_serviceable — the deterministic,
user-self-serviceable failure classifier. These are errors that recur every
turn with the same config (context window too small, no credits, bad model
id) and so must NOT be masked behind a helper-LLM fallback reply.

Root case being guarded: a NetMind user on a 32k model whose turn fails with
`litellm.ContextWindowExceededError: inputs 75307 > 32769`, which the Claude
CLI collapses to the enum `unknown`. The classifier must recognise it from
EITHER the exception class name (raw-exception path) OR the message substring
(inline path, once SDK stderr is folded into error_message).
