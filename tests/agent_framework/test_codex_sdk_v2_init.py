@description: Import-contract tests for CodexSDKv2.

Verifies:
* Protocol conformance (CodexSDKv2 satisfies AgentLoopDriver via
  structural typing).
* Method signature compatibility with v1 CodexSDK so step_3's
  driver-agnostic dispatch sees identical surfaces.
* Registry: both ``codex_cli_v2`` and ``codex_official`` names
  resolve to a CodexSDKv2 instance.
* ``_build_codex_config_overrides`` produces the right TOML-literal
  strings for the canonical inputs (MCP urls, sandbox, reasoning
  summary, permissions, writable roots).

These tests do NOT exercise the SDK itself (no subprocess, no
network) — they just lock in the static contract of v2. Live SDK
behavior is verified by ``scripts/spike_codex_official_sdk.py``
Section A/B and by Task 10's manual smoke gate.
