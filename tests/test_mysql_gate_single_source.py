@description: Every MySQL dialect twin must gate on the same env var name.

`tests/mysql_dialect.py` exists so that "run this against a real MySQL" is
described in one place, and its docstring is honest that it did not finish the
job: one twin imports it (`tests/backend/test_team_room_activity_mysql.py`)
and the rest each keep their own `MYSQL_URL_ENV = "NARRANEXUS_MYSQL_TEST_URL"`.

Copies of a string are fine right up until one of them changes. The failure mode
is the nasty kind: rename the env var in the helper (or in CI) and the copies
stop matching, their `skipif` fires, and **those dialect twins report green while
executing nothing**. That is the exact regression the
`backend-tests` CI job was added to prevent, arriving through the one door the
job cannot see — a skip is not a failure.

So until the copies are migrated, the invariant is enforced from outside: every
`*_mysql.py` twin's gate names the same variable, and the CI workflow passes that
same name to the step that runs the suite.
This test needs no MySQL and no container; it reads files.

Whoever migrates the copies into `tests.mysql_dialect` should keep this test —
it then guards the helper against CI drifting away from it, which is the half
that survives the refactor.
