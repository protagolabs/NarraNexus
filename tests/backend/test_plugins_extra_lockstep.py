@description: Executable guard for the `--extra plugins` lockstep.

The coding-agent SDKs (claude-agent-sdk / openai-codex) live in the optional
`[project.optional-dependencies].plugins` extra, kept OUT of the base install so
the local build stays light. Every place that must RUN a framework has to pull
them back in with `uv sync ... --extra plugins`; every LOCAL place must NOT
(that is the whole point of the slim-down).

This test scans every GIT-TRACKED `.sh` / `.yml` / `Dockerfile*` / Makefile for
lines that INSTALL this project with uv (`uv sync` or `uv pip install`) and
requires each such file to be explicitly classified below. A NEW deploy/CI entry
point — and forgets to classify itself — fails
`test_every_uv_install_file_is_classified` once committed (an un-added file is
invisible to `git ls-files`, but by CI/review time it is committed, so the
guard's effective coverage is unchanged) instead of silently shipping
claude_code / codex_cli dead. Same "mirror a fact + assert they agree" shape as
test_claude_cli_pin.py.

`uv pip install` counts too, and not only for the extra: uv is the ONLY
installer that understands `[tool.uv.sources]`, so an install path that reaches
for plain `pip` cannot resolve the 30 workspace members at all (the desktop DMG
build shipped exactly that bug). `test_desktop_build_installs_through_uv` pins
that one down by name because its failure is invisible until a release tag
exists.

NOTE: the deploy repo's Dockerfile.executor / Dockerfile.python are the OTHER
half of this lockstep; they live in a separate repo and are guarded on that side.
