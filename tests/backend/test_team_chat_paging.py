@description: Which 200 messages a room shows, and how to reach the rest.

The room asked for `limit=200` with no cursor, and `get_messages` is
`ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT n` — the OLDEST n. So a room that had said more
than 200 things opened on its first day and never showed the conversation the
user came back for. Every later poll used `since`, which walks forward from the
newest message on screen, so the room stayed permanently stuck in its own
prehistory. Nothing about it looked broken; it just showed the wrong end.

That is the bug. Paging is the other half: once the newest 200 are what you
open on, the older ones need a way back, which is a `before` cursor walking the
opposite direction from `since`.

The two cursors are deliberately different shapes and the tests say why:
`since` returns the OLDEST after it (catch up in order, never skip), `before`
returns the NEWEST before it (the page immediately above what you are reading).
Getting either backwards produces a room that silently loses messages rather
than one that errors.
