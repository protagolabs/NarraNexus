@description: What the sidebar is told about a room it is not looking at.

A team room is an ASYNC space by design: the user hands it work and leaves.
Without this, leaving is a one-way door — the sidebar row looks identical whether
six agents have been talking for ten minutes or nothing happened at all, so the
only way to find out is to open every room and read.

The unread mark itself is client-side (a localStorage watermark, per device, so
the server cannot know it). What the server owes the client is therefore one
timestamp: when did this room last say something WORTH coming back for. Two
exclusions decide that, and both are the difference between a useful mark and one
users learn to ignore:

  * **the user's own message doesn't count.** Otherwise sending a message badges
    the room you just sent it from.
  * **platform lines don't count.** A bulletin notice fires on the user's own
    edit; a roster notice on the user's own member change. Badging those tells
    the user someone replied when in fact they themselves acted.

And one thing this endpoint must NOT do: create the room. Listing teams is a read
— a sidebar refresh that materialised a channel for every team the user has never
opened would create rooms by looking at them.
