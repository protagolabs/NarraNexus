@description: Which cursor the inbox counts against — and why there is now only one.

**The original bug.** `bus_channel_members` carried TWO cursors.
`last_processed_at` was the trigger's bookmark ("I drove this agent past here");
`last_read_at` was what the unread list in every turn's context was measured
against, and what the inbox's "mark room read" button wrote. The inbox counted
against `last_processed_at or last_read_at`, and since the trigger advances the
former on every poll, the count read 0 forever — while the frontend only fires
mark-read when the count is above zero. The single control that could reset
`last_read_at` was therefore unreachable, for exactly the rooms whose backlog
was growing.

**What changed 2026-08-17.** The inbox moved to its own tables and
`inbox_threads` has ONE cursor. The trigger's bookmark is a bus concept and the
inbox is no longer on the bus, so the two can no longer be confused — the bug
class is gone rather than guarded against. `test_a_thread_has_exactly_one_cursor`
is what keeps it gone; it replaces "a current trigger cursor must not hide the
backlog", whose premise no longer exists.

Still pinned, because both are still reachable:
  * the mark-read endpoint clears the count — the escape hatch works
  * the agent's own posts are not its own backlog
