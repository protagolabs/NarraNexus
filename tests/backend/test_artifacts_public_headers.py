"""
Regression tests for the artifact public-raw response headers — making sure
the iframe-embedding fix (2026-05-27) doesn't get accidentally reverted.

Symptom this guards against: the dmg's artifact panel went white because
the response carried `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` + `Cross-Origin-
Resource-Policy: same-origin`, both of which made the browser refuse to
render the iframe (the parent webview is `https://tauri.localhost` while
the artifact bytes come from `http://localhost:8000` — different origin).
Surgical replacement: `frame-ancestors {parent_origin}` in CSP, with
the parent origin detected from Referer/Origin per request.
