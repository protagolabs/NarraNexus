@file_name: test_agent_rename_outcome_not_rowcount.py
@author: NarraNexus
@date: 2026-08-17
@description: PUT /api/auth/agents/{id} must report the STORED OUTCOME, never
the driver's rowcount.

`AgentRepository.update_agent` returns `cursor.rowcount`, which counts MATCHED
rows on SQLite but CHANGED rows on MySQL. The route inferred failure from
`affected_rows > 0`, so on cloud (MySQL) a rename whose value was already
stored answered `success=False, error="No changes made"` for a row that holds
exactly what the caller asked for. The user reads that as "rename failed",
retries, and gets the same answer forever — while the DB has the new name all
along. `_awareness_writes.py` defused this same trap for the agent-facing tool
in 2026-08-05; this is the user-facing HTTP twin.

The tests force the MySQL reading of rowcount (return 0) because the SQLite
fixture returns 1 for a no-op write and would pass vacuously on the very
dialect the bug cannot occur on.
