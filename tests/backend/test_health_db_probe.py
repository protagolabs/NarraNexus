@description: `/health` must report the database it actually reached.

The field used to be the literal string `"database": "connected"` — it could
not take any other value. On 2026-08-17 the backend spent 19 minutes failing
every query with `InterfaceError: (0, 'Not connected')` while this endpoint
reported a connected database, the container healthcheck stayed green, and the
monitoring built on that container state never fired.

So the property under test is not "the endpoint returns 200". It is: **when the
database is unreachable, this endpoint says so, and says it loudly enough for a
container probe to notice.**
