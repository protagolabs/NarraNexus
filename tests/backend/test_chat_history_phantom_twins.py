@description: Replay-layer net for the legacy duplicate `events` rows.

Until 2026-08-05, step 4.4 authored a copy of the turn's event row into every
auxiliary narrative. Those copies are still in every deployed database and
cannot be deleted (铁律 #6 — no destructive migration), so `/chat-history`
filters them at read time: a row whose `event_log` is empty while a sibling
row with the same input AND the same `final_output` carries a real log is a
copy, not a turn.

The filter must be conservative — a genuine turn that produced no event_log
(crashed before its first step) still has to show up.
