@description: EVERY writer of ``agents.agent_name`` must record the rename in
the Awareness profile — not just the agent-facing tool.

Shenzhen round 2, P1 (prod agent_4a0ae5f40af2, retest 2026-08-14 by
xiyue.liang). The agent was created 「小绿」, renamed to 「美食家」 through its own
``update_agent_profile`` tool — which appended the identity-correction line the
2026-08-04 transaction was built for — and then renamed BACK to 「小绿」 from the
UI. The HTTP route wrote the column and refreshed the peer directory, but wrote
no note, so the profile kept asserting, in the platform's own voice:

    - 2026-08-14: renamed ... to 「美食家」. You are 「美食家」.
      「小绿」 is no longer your name — ...

``agents.agent_name`` said 小绿 and ``bus_agent_registry`` said 小绿, while the
system prompt carried a platform record instructing the agent to REJECT 小绿.
Asked "你是谁", it answered 美食家 — twice, and with justification. This is not
memory that failed to keep up; it is the platform telling the agent something
false, so a test that only renames a fresh agent would miss it: the note must
be SUPERSEDED, not merely present.
