@description: A renamed team is renamed everywhere its agents can see.

The room carries its own copy of the name, and that copy is the one agents
read — `Your Channels` renders `bus_channels.name`. A rename that stopped at
the teams table left every member citing the old name back at the user while
the UI showed the new one, with nothing in either place to explain the
disagreement.
