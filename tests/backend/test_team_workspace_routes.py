@description: The team workspace's read surface, and its cleanup.

Two routes give the team room the panel it never had (`teams.py` carried no
artifact or file route at all), plus the cleanup that has to keep up with the
two new tables.

The cleanup half is the easier one to get wrong: `_wipe_team_data` deletes the
shared directory from disk, so if the index is not deleted with it the UI
happily lists files that no longer exist — rows pointing at nothing, which is
worse than showing nothing, because the user cannot tell the difference until
a download fails.
