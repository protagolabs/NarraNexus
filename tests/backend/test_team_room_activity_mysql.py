@description: The room-activity query against a real MySQL dialect.

`_team_room_activity` is the one piece of SQL in this change whose dialect
differences would show up in RESULTS rather than in an error: `created_at` is
TEXT compared lexicographically on SQLite and `DATETIME(6)` compared as a time
on MySQL, and the query leans on that comparison twice — once inside a `MAX()`
per channel, once joining that maximum back to the row that produced it.

Everything else about it (a derived table with an alias, `GROUP BY`, `NOT IN`,
`IS NULL`) is common to both, and `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` is satisfied. But
"probably fine" is exactly the confidence level that produced the last two
dialect incidents, and a wrong answer here is silent: the sidebar shows the
wrong message, or no mark at all, and nothing errors.

Run with a throwaway MySQL:

    docker run --rm -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \\
        -e MYSQL_DATABASE=nxtest --name nx-mysql-test mysql:8
    export NARRANEXUS_MYSQL_TEST_URL=mysql://root:root@127.0.0.1:3306/nxtest

# a fourth hand-rolled copy, and it normalises the datetime/string asymmetry this
# file exists for — but within ONE backend both operands always share a wire
# type, so nothing here can observe the difference. Saying so beats writing a
# test that asserts a state the schema forbids.
