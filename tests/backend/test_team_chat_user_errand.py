@description: The user's own hand-offs reach the board too.

`message_bus/errand.py` records a hand-off when one agent @mentions another,
and it is wired into `MessageBusTrigger` — the path an AGENT's reply takes. A
person's message reaches the bus from this route instead, so "@Bruno pull the
numbers", ignored, left no trace anywhere: no board row, nothing for patrol to
sweep, nothing in the closure-rate report.

That is the one broken hand-off a person actually witnesses. An agent ignoring
another agent is invisible to them; being ignored themselves is not.

Driven over HTTP rather than by asserting on the route's source, for the reason
`test_team_chat_paging` records: a source assertion goes red on a rename and
green on a behavioural regression.
