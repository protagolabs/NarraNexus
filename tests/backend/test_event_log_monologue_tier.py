@date: 2026-08-30

Replay-side net for the interim-narration tier (design A′).

NexusPower's own assistant text ("monologue") streams as thinking but is a
different tier from provider chain-of-thought: the frontend renders it at the
"progress" tier while CoT keeps receding. The distinction is written to
``events.event_log`` by ``execution_state.record_thinking`` and, until this
change, was dropped at the API layer — so a turn looked different live than it
did after a refresh, breaking the equivalence ``segmentTurn`` is built on.

The batcher upstream coalesces the DISPLAY stream (monologue + CoT mixed, iron
rule #16 verbatim) while ``monologue`` carries only the monologue SUBSET. So a
persisted step is progress-tier only when it is tier-PURE — ``monologue`` is
non-empty and equals ``content``. A mixed step has no recoverable split point
(we have the union and the subset, never the positions), so it falls back to
plain thinking: never brighten CoT, never invent a boundary.
