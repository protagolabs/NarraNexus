@description: Viewing a team artifact's raw content.

The existing mint route requires the caller's agent to BE the artifact's
agent, which is exactly wrong for a team: the team panel shows work produced
by several members, and a teammate opening a colleague's artifact is the
normal case, not an attack.

The token payload is deliberately unchanged. Authorisation happens at MINT —
that is where the existing design already puts it — so the team check lives in
the team route and the token keeps carrying the PRODUCER's agent_id, which is
what the raw serving path resolves against. Nothing downstream has to learn
about teams.

What must not change: the artifact still has to be in THAT team. A token
minted through a team the caller owns must not reach another team's artifact,
nor a private one.
