@description: Pin every (method, path, endpoint) the backend app registers, for the production shape.

Baseline for the plugin-platform refactor: route registration moves from
hand-written ``include_router`` lines to a registry, and this snapshot is the
proof that the set of routes did not change while that happens.

The app is imported in a fresh interpreter with a built frontend present
(``FRONTEND_DIST`` pointing at a directory with an ``index.html``), because
that is the shape the desktop bundle and the cloud image serve — the SPA
fallback routes are exactly the ones a route-registry refactor is most likely
to lose. The Manyfold-gated routers are pinned separately.
