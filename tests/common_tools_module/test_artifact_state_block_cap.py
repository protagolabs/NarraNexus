@description: The 'Your registered artifacts' block is capped.

The block used to list EVERY pinned artifact an agent owned, with no limit
and no ordering, on EVERY turn — so an agent that keeps registering grows
its own system prompt without bound (artifacts have no quota). Capping it
to the most recently updated N is the fix; the full set stays reachable
through the artifact tooling, so nothing is lost, it is just not all
carried in-context every turn.

Ordering by updated_at is what makes the cap self-correcting: re-registering
an artifact (the update path) refreshes the timestamp, so whatever the agent
is actively iterating on stays listed and only genuinely cold entries fall
off.
