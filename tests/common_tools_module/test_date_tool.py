@description: Lock the calendar arithmetic behind resolve_relative_date /
compare_dates.

These tools exist because agents were doing this arithmetic by reasoning and
getting it wrong silently. A test suite that only checked the happy path
would leave exactly the cases that bite: week boundaries, month-end
clamping, the timezone in which "today" is decided, and the past/future
comparison that the reported incident actually failed.

The tools are registered on a FastMCP server, so the tests pull the
registered handlers off a real server instance rather than reaching into
module-private functions — that way a registration mistake (wrong name,
tool not registered at all) fails here too.
