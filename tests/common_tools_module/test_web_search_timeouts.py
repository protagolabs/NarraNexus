@description: Bug 20 — three-layer timeout defense for the DDGS-backed
`mcp__common_tools_module__web_search` tool.

The incident: on 2026-04-18 18:15:36, a single DDGS call wedged the
shared MCP container for 33+ hours. Root cause chain — DDGS library's
``ThreadPoolExecutor.__exit__`` blocks on stuck primp/libcurl threads
that never finish; our ``_search_sync`` had no external timeout; our
``asyncio.gather`` had no ``wait_for``; the MCP tool handler had no
outer bound. Every layer delegated the timeout to the next layer
down — none of them had one.

These tests pin the three-layer fix:

1. ``DDGS()`` is constructed with an explicit ``timeout=5``.
2. Per-query: ``_one`` wraps ``asyncio.to_thread(_search_sync, ...)``
   in ``asyncio.wait_for(..., 15)`` and returns a structured per-query
   error on timeout (does NOT raise).
3. Overall: ``search_many`` wraps the gather in ``asyncio.wait_for(...,
   30)``; on timeout, returns a bundle per query marked as timed out.

Tests use ``monkeypatch`` to replace ``_search_sync`` with a
controllable sync blocker so we can simulate the production hang
without hitting the real network.

# These three used to wait out the real ladder: 15s and 30s of genuine
# sleeping, plus the to_thread blockers still running at loop teardown —
# 80 of the suite's 178 seconds, for timeouts whose only interesting property
# is that they fire. Scaled down the same way the Brave twin next door already
# does it (`test_web_search_brave_tool.py`); the ladder's real values are
# pinned above.
#
# The blockers still outlive the test — `asyncio.run` joins the default executor
# at loop close — but they now sleep 1.5s instead of 25s, so teardown went from
# ~10s to ~1.25s rather than to zero.

# Scaled 100x/60x/50x, not ~300x, on purpose. The assertions have to separate
# "the cap fired" from "the blocker finished" on a loaded CI runner, and a
# 50ms budget makes thread-pool startup jitter look like a missing timeout.
# A flaky guard is worse than a slow one.
# Inert in practice — DDGS_CLIENT_TIMEOUT_S is only read inside `_search_sync`,
# which all three tests below monkeypatch away. Kept so the fixture hands over a
# COMPLETE ladder: a future test that exercises the real `_search_sync` should
