@description: "This agent has no description yet" must be one shared judgement.

P1 section 02 (prod, 2026-08-03): every agent ever created carried
``agent_description = "A new agent ready for configuration"`` — creation wrote
it, nothing ever replaced it, and three surfaces then repeated it as if it were
a fact:

  * ``bus_agent_registry`` snapshots it → the agent-profile lookup (since removed) answers
    "a new agent ready for configuration" for a fully configured agent, so the
    ASKING agent concluded the peer was unconfigured and refused to send
    (evt_feb1f6ae). 488 registry rows, all placeholder.
  * the Known Agents list injected into every bus turn shows the same string
    for every peer, so "ask the teaching expert" has nothing to aim at.
  * BasicInfo injects it as the agent's OWN self-description, so the asked
    agent reads "I am a new agent ready for configuration" too.

Creation no longer writes the placeholder, but 488 prod rows carry it, so
"unset" has to recognise both the empty and the legacy form. One helper, so a
surface cannot accidentally treat the legacy string as real prose.
