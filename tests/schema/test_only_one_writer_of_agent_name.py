@description: The invariant this whole area rests on, as a gate rather than a
request: every write to the `agents` row goes through a known place.

Renaming an agent is three writes — the column, the identity correction in its
Awareness profile, and the peer-discovery row — and for a while it had four
writers each remembering a different subset (Shenzhen round 2, P1). The fix was
to give the transaction one home. What KEEPS it one home was, until this test, a
`git grep` written into a mirror md for the next person to run by hand — and
that same md argues, correctly, that an expectation nobody enforces has already
failed twice here: the 2026-08-04 fix lasted ten days before a second writer
went around it.

So the allowlist lives HERE, where it runs. The mirror points at this file
rather than carrying its own copy — two lists drift, and the executable one is
the one that is true.

# One exception, stated because a gate is only worth its reasons: bundle/importer
# DOES rename — it clamps, appends a dedupe suffix, and falls back on an empty
# name — and it copies instance_awareness row for row, so an imported agent can
# arrive declaring the name it had in the bundle. It is allowed here because the
# row is created rather than updated (the transaction's precondition is a row it
# may write), and it calls reconcile_identity_record after the awareness insert
# instead. Do not copy "creation paths need no correction" onto the next entry
# without checking whether that entry renames.
