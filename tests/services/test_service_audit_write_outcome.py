@description: Pin that a failed audit INSERT is reported as a failure.

The DM fallback gate arms a 10-minute audit cooldown on the strength of a
successful write. That guarantee is only as good as the weakest link in
`ServiceAuditor.event() -> ServiceAuditRepository.record() -> db.insert()`,
and every link here is written to swallow its own exceptions. A link that
swallows the exception AND the outcome turns "row written" into something
indistinguishable from "the DB was down" — which is how the cooldown ended
up being armed on failures.

The same PR has already shipped one guarantee that only a test fake had.
These tests drive the real repository against a failing db handle.
