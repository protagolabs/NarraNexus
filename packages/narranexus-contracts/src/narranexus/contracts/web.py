@description: Contract for the request-scoped host API a plugin router needs (identity, ownership, CSRF, host settings, egress).

Why this exists
---------------
Thirteen builtin routers moved into plugin packages in batch 6b, but their
dependencies did not move with them: they kept importing
``backend.routes._ownership``, ``backend.auth``, ``backend.auth_errors`` and
``backend.config`` — six of those are underscore-private modules. A plugin
reaching into the host's private modules is exactly what
``docs/API_POLICY.md`` §1 forbids, and it is worse than the pre-move state:
a third party copying ``builtin.job`` (the documented router sample) cannot
import any of it, so their only options are to rewrite ownership checks by
hand (the 2026-08-12 IDOR batch came from exactly that) or to depend on a
private module of ours.

The seam
--------
``WebHost`` is everything a router legitimately needs from the HTTP host.
The host registers ONE implementation on the service locator under
``narranexus.contracts.services:WEB_HOST`` at boot; plugins call it through
``narranexus.sdk.web``. Every method is request-scoped on purpose: identity
and ownership are properties of a request, never of a process, so the seam
takes the request object rather than a pre-extracted user id — a plugin that
had to extract the id itself would have to reimplement the local-mode /
cloud-mode difference the host middleware exists to hide.

``request`` is typed ``Any`` so this package stays framework-free (the same
reason ``contracts.route.RouterSpec.router`` is ``Any``); the backend host
passes a Starlette ``Request``.

Contract version: ``API_VERSIONS["web"]``. Stability: ALPHA — the surface is
one batch old and the ownership/visibility split is still being reviewed.
