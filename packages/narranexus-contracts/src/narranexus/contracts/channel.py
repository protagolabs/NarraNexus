@description: Contract for IM channels (slot ``ingress.channels``) — one descriptor per channel.

A channel used to be six scattered facts: a trigger class in the trigger
map, a module in module_registry, a credential manager + bind service in the
data-access ``CHANNELS`` table, a ``WorkingSource`` enum member, a
message-source handler and a hard-coded frontend row. ``ChannelDescriptor``
is that record as data: the platform reads every one of those tables from
the registry, and a channel plugin is one descriptor plus its classes.

A channel also declares its MESSAGE SOURCE here (``reply_tools`` /
``row_prefix_template`` / ``reply_extractor_ref`` / ``dedicated_trigger``):
the facts that used to be a module-level ``MessageSourceRegistry.register``
call executed as an import side effect, invisible to the registry, to
``registry.json`` and to distributions. ``ChannelDescriptor.message_source``
projects them as a ``MessageSourceSpec``, the same record a NON-channel
source (the message bus, the job clock) contributes into
``ingress.message_sources``.

``credential_schema`` is the generic bind form (batch 4b) — fields the
platform stores split into public and secret halves; ``transport`` says how
events arrive (``socket`` = the trigger keeps a connection, ``poll`` = it
polls, ``webhook`` = the platform's webhook endpoint feeds it, ``none`` =
credentials only, no inbound). Class references are ``"pkg.mod:Name"``
strings resolved lazily so declaring a channel never imports its SDK.

Contract version: ``API_VERSIONS["channel"]``.

    the LLM?" (``row_prefix_template``). It is pure DATA — the behaviour lives in
    the platform's ``MessageSourceHandler``, which is built from one of these.

    Two kinds of provider:

    * a channel — its ``ChannelDescriptor.message_source`` projects one, so the
      channel stays ONE record and a channel excluded from a distribution takes
      its message source with it;
    * a non-channel source (the message bus, the job clock) — its plugin
      contributes one into the ``ingress.message_sources`` slot.

    Sources that need nothing source-specific (owner chat, ``a2a``,
    ``callback``, ``skill_study``) declare NOTHING: the platform's default
    handler is exactly right for them, and that is the only fallback left.
