@description: Contract for agent-loop frameworks (slot ``turn.pipeline.act.framework``).

A framework driver runs one agent turn as a stream of raw, provider-agnostic
event dicts. This is the canonical home of the ``AgentLoopDriver`` Protocol
that ``narranexus.platform.agent_framework.loop.driver`` used to define; the
legacy module now re-exports it so every existing import keeps resolving to
the same object.

Contract version: ``API_VERSIONS["framework"]``.

        Capability negotiation seam: the orchestrator and frontend switch
        optional behaviour on the declared set instead of hardcoding
        per-framework knowledge. An empty set means "base contract only". The
        remote (HTTP) driver answers from the WRAPPED framework's
        ``FrameworkMeta.capabilities`` intersected with what the executor hop
        can actually carry (``steering``, via ``/steer`` + ``steer_consumed``
        frames — see remote_driver.py / executor_service.py), so its answer is

class FrameworkMeta:
    """Static description of a framework — the ONLY place framework-specific
    facts live. Every host-side table that used to be keyed on a framework
    name (protocol requirement, subscription-card ownership, install probe,
    login marker, the agent's self-description, live steering, native history
    replay, the cloud credential-riding gate) is derived from the framework
    registry's ``Contribution.meta["framework"]`` at call time, so a
    third-party framework is a first-class citizen the moment it registers.
    There is no remaining host-side table keyed on a framework NAME; the one
    thing a framework may not attest about itself is the operator's cloud
    exemption (see ``providers/cloud_policy.py``), because a fail-open
    self-declaration is exactly what that gate exists to prevent.

    ``install`` is ``None`` for frameworks that ship inside the host and a
    ``FrameworkInstall`` for the on-demand ones. ``oauth_source`` names the
    subscription provider card (``user_providers.source``) that ONLY this
    framework's CLI can redeem — ``None`` when the framework accepts no
    subscription credential. ``runtime_name`` is what the agent calls its own
    runtime in prompts (defaults to ``display_name``); ``login_marker`` is the
    ``(subdir, filename)`` under the home directory whose presence means the
    CLI is logged in.

    ``capabilities`` is the STATIC twin of ``AgentLoopDriver.capabilities()``:
    the words in it must come from :data:`CAPABILITY_VOCABULARY` and must
    match what the driver actually implements. It exists because some hosts
    must know a framework's capability WITHOUT constructing its driver — the
    remote (executor) shell decides whether to carry live steering over the
    hop, and history projection decides whether a past turn can be replayed
    natively, both before any driver exists in this process. Declaring a word
    the driver does not honour is worse than omitting it: the orchestrator
    gates behaviour on the declaration (a declared-but-undrained ``steering``
    leaves the user's interjection queued forever).

    ``uses_shared_cli_login`` says the framework can authenticate through a
    credential FILE in the host's HOME (``~/.claude/.credentials.json``,
    ``~/.codex/auth.json``) rather than a per-agent provider key. It defaults
    to ``True`` — fail-closed: a framework that does not think about this
    question is treated as able to ride a shared login, which is what the
    cloud gate refuses for non-staff users. Set it ``False`` only when the
    framework drives the provider API with the key of the card bound to the
    agent slot and REFUSES subscription credentials outright.
