@description: Contract for skill contributions (slot ``content.skills``).

A skill is a directory with a ``SKILL.md`` (the OpenClaw format and its
aliases). Plugins point at such directories; the skill module scans them
like workspace skills and records ``kind`` so the catalog can tell a
plugin-shipped skill from a marketplace or hand-written one.

Contract version: ``API_VERSIONS["skill"]``.
