@description: Stage strategies (the vertical slots) and the per-agent pipeline profile that selects them.

Today fast mode, voice mode, job turns and silent IM ingestion are boolean
knobs scattered across the runtime steps. A ``PipelineProfile`` names them:
one strategy per stage, a budget, and an optional capability filter. Built-in
profiles are ``default``, ``fast``, ``voice``, ``job`` and ``silent``; plugins
contribute more; an agent binds one; a turn may override it.

``StageStrategy`` is structural: a strategy for stage S is any object with an
``async run(inputs) -> S's context value``. The platform's turn runtime is the
only caller, so the argument shape is the platform's ``StageInputs`` (not part
of the public contract yet — alpha).

# A profile says WHEN it applies as data, so selecting one is not an if-chain
# in the platform (which no plugin profile could ever reach). Deliberately
# tiny and closed — a predicate language, not an expression language: no
# arbitrary attribute access, no calls, no numbers, no eval. The frontend's
# slot-point predicates (``frontend/src/platform/registries/when.ts``) are the
# same IDEA with a different vocabulary (``conversationKind:`` / ``agentHas:``
# / ``setting:``); that grammar is keyed on UI facts and cannot express a turn
# fact like ``source == 'discord'``, so this is a sibling, not a copy. Both
# stay closed vocabularies for the same reason: a typo must be a parse error,
# never "always true".
