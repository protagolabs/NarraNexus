@description: ``narranexus.sdk.web`` — the request-scoped host API a plugin router calls (identity, ownership, CSRF, settings, egress).

A plugin router needs four things the host owns: who is calling, whether
they may touch this agent, the host's deployment settings, and the host's
egress policy. Before this module those came from ``backend.auth``,
``backend.routes._ownership``, ``backend.routes._mcp_egress`` and
``backend.config`` — three of them underscore-private, none of them
importable by a third-party plugin. That made the documented router sample
(``builtin.job``) uncopyable, and left "write your own ownership check" as
the only option for anyone outside this repo — the exact origin of the
2026-08-12 IDOR batch.

These are thin module-level functions rather than a class the plugin holds,
because a router body has no injection point: the seam has to be callable
from inside a handler with nothing but the request. Each call resolves the
one ``WebHost`` implementation the host exposed at boot
(``contracts.services:WEB_HOST``); resolution happens per call, not at
import, so a router module can be imported in a process that has not booted
yet (route collection at import time is how the backend builds its route
table).

``UnknownEntry`` from ``host()`` is the honest failure: it means this
process has no HTTP host, i.e. a router is being invoked from a worker or
MCP role. It is never silently degraded to "allow". The one exception is
``host_settings()``: settings are deployment facts, not request facts, and
resolve from the environment where no HTTP host exists.
