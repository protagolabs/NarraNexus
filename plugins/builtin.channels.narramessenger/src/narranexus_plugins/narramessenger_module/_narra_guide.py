@description: Curated command reference for the ``narra_guide`` MCP tool.

We deliberately do NOT serve narra's live ``runtime.md``. That document is written
for a runtime that installs / configures / runs narra-cli itself (``npx
@narra-im/narra-cli@latest ... --endpoint $NARRA_API_ENDPOINT --token-file
.narra/<id>/agent-runtime-token``, ``AGENTS.md`` bootstrap blocks, …). In OUR
architecture narra-cli is platform-provided via the ``narra_cli`` MCP tool, which
injects the token AND the binding's endpoint per call, so those setup
instructions are actively harmful: a capable agent that follows the guide tries
to install narra-cli in its sandbox and fails (2026-07-20 dev incident — Opus hit
"narra-cli cannot init its config dir, chmod permission denied"), or keeps its
own token file and "compares" tokens in chat (2026-09-09 prod incident).

Instead we serve a small **curated command reference** (``resources/narra-runtime.md``)
that carries a strong "platform provides it, use the tool" banner and only the
command *shapes*. We do NOT lose freshness: the agent gets the exact / latest
flags of any command from the live CLI via ``narra_cli("<domain> --help")``. The
only maintenance this needs is when narra adds a whole new top-level DOMAIN —
which already requires a ``ALLOWED_DOMAINS`` whitelist edit in
``_narra_command_security``, so the two move together.

Independent per binding rule #3.
