@description: The ProviderProfile data table — onboarding a provider is
adding a row.

Rows encode measured dialect behaviour only (cache style, window,
argument-delta support). No row ever encodes a judgement about a
model's fitness (iron rule #15): unknown providers resolve to a
conservative default so every user model runs — it merely forgoes the
optimizations until its row is measured in.

Per-model limits are NOT this table's to invent: ``resolve_profile``
overlays ``providers/model_catalog``, the platform-wide source that
``adapters/openai_agents`` and ``llm/anthropic_helper`` already read. So
every framework that goes through our own client gets the same numbers,
and adding a model is one catalog row rather than one row per caller.

The rows here carry DIALECT only, keyed by protocol. That distinction
is load-bearing: ``provider`` is the resolved protocol, and one protocol
serves many vendors — NetMind's free-tier card speaks anthropic while
serving Qwen, DeepSeek and MiMo. Keying a ceiling off it would hand a 7B
model a 128K output request.

A ceiling set below what the model allows does not save anything: it
severs tool arguments mid-JSON, and the model cannot see the cut or
recover from it (2026-07-30 incident — a single write_file retried into
a loop against an 8_192 ceiling). Cost and depth are the caller's dials
(iron rule #15), not this table's.

    answers a violation with a 400 that names neither "context window"
    nor any other marker the overflow table watches — so it would arrive
    as an unretryable INVALID_REQUEST and kill the turn.

    Measured on the dev gateway 2026-07-31: opus-4-8 accepted 144_065
    input tokens alongside ``max_tokens=128_000``, which puts its real
    window far beyond the 200_000 this module manages compaction
    against. So for the Opus and Sonnet rows this clamp never binds. It
    exists for Haiku, whose window really is 200_000: our compaction
    only trips at 150_000, leaving a band where an unclamped 64_000
    request would exceed the limit.

    budget too small to ever produce output (2026-09-08 incident). The
    floor is clamped against the model's OWN ceiling last, though — a
    thinking-by-default model whose measured ceiling sits below the
    thinking floor (DeepSeek-V3's real 7_200) must not be asked for more
    than it accepts.

    ``floor_multiplier`` scales the floor term ONLY — never the ceiling
    or the headroom term — and the ceiling still clamps last. It does NOT
    make the result respect headroom: the floor already wins over
    headroom (above), so a multiplied floor widens that same over-the-wall
