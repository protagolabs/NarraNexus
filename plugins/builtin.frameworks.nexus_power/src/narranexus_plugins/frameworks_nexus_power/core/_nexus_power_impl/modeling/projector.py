@description: ContextProjector implementations.

v1 = PassthroughProjector: the materialized base (platform-built
messages plus the framework's appended harness prompt) followed by this
turn's ledger-projected messages. Compaction is present from v1 but as
a separate concern: the ``CompactionPolicy`` appends replacement
entries, the LEDGER substitutes them in its projection, and this class
just concatenates — upgrading compaction never touches projection.

The one dialect decision taken here: ``profile.thinking_replay``. The
ledger folds the provider's chain-of-thought into each assistant message
as ``reasoning_content``; a "strip" profile never sends it (providers
that do not know the key may reject it), a "keep" profile replays it
(DeepSeek's thinking mode refuses the next request of a tool round
without it).
