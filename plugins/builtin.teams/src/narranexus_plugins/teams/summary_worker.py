@description: Background worker that keeps each team's progress summary fresh.

The bulletin's third source, after the user and the agents: "what is the team
actually up to", so a member joining a long task does not have to reconstruct
it from twenty messages of scrollback.

Shaped after `MemoryConsolidationWorker`, which is the codebase's one proven
pattern for background LLM work: poll loop, per-item isolation, and a failure
that never propagates. Iron rule #14 applies directly — this is opportunistic
work that must never force-stop or delay a turn.

**Why not have an agent do it.** Asking the lead agent to summarise would spend
a user-configured agent slot, produce a turn the user did not ask for, and put
the summary in that agent's history but nobody else's — which is precisely the
asymmetry the bulletin exists to remove. The summary belongs to the team, so
the platform writes it.

**Why no counter column.** The trigger is "how many messages since the last
summary", computed live against `idx_bus_msg_channel_time`. A counter is a
second source of truth that drifts the first time a message is deleted or a
wipe runs; the live count has nothing to keep in sync and nothing to repair.

The high-water mark is a TIMESTAMP because `bus_messages` has no monotonic id —
`message_id` is a random string and the table's only ordering is `created_at`,
which is also what its index covers. Messages sharing a timestamp can therefore
be counted one out; that is acceptable for a "have 15 things happened" trigger
and would not be for anything that must not skip a row.

**Why failure keeps the old summary.** Blanking on failure would convert one
provider hiccup into the loss of the team's only shared progress view, and an
empty summary does not read as "unknown" to the next reader — it reads as "this
team has made no progress".

**Why the cap truncates instead of refusing.** The opposite of the policy for
user entries, deliberately. A user's rule is never silently shortened, because
they would go on believing the whole rule is in force. Nobody depends on the
exact wording of a generated paragraph, and refusing an over-long one outright
would leave the team with no progress view at all.

**Why a failed team backs off.** The poll is 60 s and "keep the previous
summary" says nothing about how soon to try again. Retrying at full poll rate
turned one owner's empty balance into ~1,000 identical error lines an hour for
three days (2026-09-07 prod): the call cannot succeed until something outside
this process changes, and asking every minute only buries the log. A team that
failed waits an exponentially growing, capped interval (5 min → 6 h, the
shared `utils/backoff.py` formula) before it is tried again. A model that was
called and answered with nothing waits the same way: the transcript it would be
shown next minute is the same one, so the answer would be too, and each ask is
billed. Only a written summary, or a pass that never reached the model, clears
the wait. The wait is kept in memory on purpose — a restart is a fine reason to
try once more — but every failure also goes through
`alert_background_llm_failure`, so it leaves a `service_audit` row and, for a
credential or out-of-credit error, a deduplicated owner inbox notice: quieting
the log must not leave an owner with an empty balance and no way to find out.
