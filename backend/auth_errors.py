@description: One vocabulary for every 401 the backend can emit, plus the
logging that makes those rejections diagnosable.

Why this module exists
----------------------
A 401 used to be a single undifferentiated signal. The frontend saw only
the status code, so it could not tell these apart:

- the session JWT is expired / forged / absent  → the session IS dead
- a *second* credential failed (NetMind login token, Manyfold gateway
  token, an OpenAI-compatible API key)          → the session is fine
- the handler could not resolve an identity that the middleware already
  verified                                      → an internal bug

It treated all three as "your session is dead" and destroyed the whole
SPA session. On 2026-08-02 that fired repeatedly during a live demo: a
stale NetMind token on `/api/providers` bounced users to /login mid-run.

Every 401 now carries a `code`, and only ``SESSION_DEAD_CODES`` means
"log the user out". Anything a future author forgets to classify falls
outside that set and is therefore *safe by default* — the failure mode
of an unknown code is a local error, not a global logout.

The second half of the module is observability. The middleware used to
return a bare ``JSONResponse`` with no logger call at all, which is why
the 8/2 incident could not be diagnosed from server logs: we had ten
401s with a path and nothing else. ``log_auth_rejection`` emits one
``[auth-reject]`` line per rejection carrying the code and — for token
failures — the token's own iat/exp, which is what distinguishes a
naturally-expired token from one signed with a different key.
