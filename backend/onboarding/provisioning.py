@description: Idempotent provisioning of the onboarding guide agent — the
"new user's first agent". Called fire-and-forget from the login paths
(netmind-login, local login, local create-user); never blocks or fails a
login. Mirrors ArenaProvisioningService's shape: random name, awareness
persona, targeted skill install, a pre-created routine — but the routine here
is live from day one (the daily check-in IS the product) rather than a paused
consent gate.

Idempotency is USER-level, not agent-level: a write-once TOP-LEVEL
`users.metadata.guide_agent_provisioned` marker. Top-level on purpose — the
`onboarding_progress` sub-dict is wholesale-replaced by
POST /api/auth/onboarding (three fixed checklist booleans), so a marker
nested there would be wiped the first time the user created an agent in the
UI. An agent-level marker alone would resurrect the guide after the user
deletes it — deleting it must stick.

Placement (铁律 #21): lives under backend/ because its only consumers are the
login routes; nothing agent-side imports any of this.

# The daily check-in is a plain SCHEDULED job, deliberately NOT "ongoing":
# an ONGOING job's iteration counter and end_condition analysis also run on
# every CHAT event (hook_after_event_execution), which would (a) burn a
# max_iterations budget on ordinary conversation — a chatty first week would
# silently kill the "daily companionship" — and (b) add one Helper-LLM
# analysis call to EVERY chat turn of every new user. A scheduled job fires
# once a day and touches nothing else. Exit paths: (1) the user pausing/
# cancelling in the Jobs panel (the greeting says how); (2) the payload's
# three-ignored-check-ins goodbye + self-pause (model-judged); (3) the
# PLATFORM-ENFORCED trigger_config.end_at horizon — once the next fire would
# land past provision-time + CHECKIN_END_AFTER_DAYS, JobTrigger completes the
# job with no model cooperation. The payload's end-date sentence is the
# polite goodbye script for (3), not the brake itself — and the date it
# quotes is the day BEFORE end_at, worded "{end_date} or later". Why the
# day before: compute_next_run schedules each fire from the previous run's
# ACTUAL completion time, so every round drifts a little later; by fire #13
# the computed next fire (#14) has drifted past end_at = T0+14d, so the
# LAST fire the horizon allows lands on day 13 — end_at's own day never
# fires. Quoting end_at's date meant the goodbye could never run and the
# guide silently vanished mid-smalltalk (review round-3 finding A; the
# drift-simulation test in test_onboarding_provisioning.py pins this).
# "or later" keeps the goodbye firing even if drift pushes the last fire
# past a midnight into day 14.
#
# ROBUSTNESS: the "minus one day" is stable under drift of ANY magnitude, not
# just small drift. Per-run drift delays the fire INSTANT by the same amount
# it advances the horizon crossing (an earlier fire index), so the two cancel
# and the last allowed fire's DATE stays on the goodbye day. Verified in
# test_onboarding_provisioning.py at 3h and 12h per round (orders of magnitude
# past a real check-in). The brake never depends on the goodbye either way —
# the platform completes on schedule regardless.
