@description: The PluginInstaller strategy contract, its result type, and
              the shared subprocess-streaming helper both concrete
              installers (pip_target, npm_prefix) build on.

Why a shared subprocess helper
-------------------------------
Both installers shell out to a package manager and want the same behavior:
stream stdout+stderr line-by-line as install progress, and on a non-zero
exit raise one exception that carries the full captured output — so
``errors.classify_error`` has something to pattern-match against. Keeping
that plumbing here (rather than duplicated in both installer files) is the
only shared logic between two otherwise-independent strategies.
