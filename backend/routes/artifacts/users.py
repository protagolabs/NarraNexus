@description: User-scoped artifact endpoints — cross-agent list + bulk delete.

Backs the Settings → Artifacts management UI. Distinct from
agents_artifacts.py (agent-scoped routes) because the management UI needs to
see the full user-owned set across every agent the user owns, and let them
delete in bulk.

Endpoints:
- GET    /{user_id}/artifacts                 list every artifact owned by user
- DELETE /{user_id}/artifacts                 bulk delete registry rows only

Registry-only delete (2026-05-14-r3): workspace files are never removed by
this endpoint. The user cleans those up via the agent's workspace section.
