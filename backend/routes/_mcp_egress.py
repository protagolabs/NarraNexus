@description: Cloud-only SSRF egress filter for user-configured MCP servers.

The enabled MCP URLs a user stores are fetched at agent RUNTIME — their
response bodies land in the model's context — so a URL that resolves to an
internal address (cloud metadata 169.254.169.254, docker-network services)
is a data-exfiltration vector, not just a validate-time concern. The store-
time screen in routes/agents/mcps.py is DNS-free and only catches literal
internal hosts; a public-looking name that resolves internal slips past it.
This filter runs the real post-resolution check on the enabled specs right
before a run, so all runtime consumers (websocket, skills) inherit it.

Cloud only (铁律 #7): a local/desktop install is a single trusted user who
legitimately runs MCP servers on localhost; the OS user is the trust
boundary and a local agent has bash anyway.

Note: like the validate-time gate, this NARROWS but does not close the DNS-
rebinding window — the eventual fetch re-resolves the hostname. Full closure
needs connection pinning to the validated IP (tracked as a follow-up).
