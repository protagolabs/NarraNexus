@description: HTTP surface for backend.integrations.plugins.PluginService —
              lets the local/desktop Settings -> Plugins panel list, install,
              and uninstall the optional coding-agent framework plugins
              (Claude Code, Codex CLI).

Cloud deployments pre-install these platform-side (the images ship the SDKs
in the base environment, so ``framework_installed`` already reports True
without a plugin tree), so the install/uninstall verbs are local/desktop
only — a cloud caller gets 403 before anything runs. The list endpoint stays
available everywhere: the frontend uses ``cloud_managed`` to decide whether
to render install/uninstall controls at all, rather than hiding the whole
panel and losing the ability to show plugin status.

Authentication is the ordinary global gate: this router is not in
``backend.auth.AUTH_EXEMPT_PATHS``, so ``auth_middleware`` already requires
an authenticated caller (401 otherwise) before any handler here runs. No
handler reads ``request.state.user_id`` because plugin install state is a
machine-local property, not per-user data.
