@description: Web-UI feedback relay — the frontend dialog posts here and the
backend forwards to the team's feedback intake through feedback_client.

Why relay instead of posting from the browser: no CORS surface on the intake,
the NARRANEXUS_FEEDBACK_DISABLED kill switch applies server-side for the whole
deployment, and in cloud mode the user_id comes from the JWT session (local
mode has no auth by design and falls back to the query param, matching every
other local-mode route).

Privacy: the user's typed text travels verbatim (they wrote it FOR the team);
identifiers are hashed by feedback_client. The send is one awaited attempt
capped at 3 s — the dialog shows a sending state meanwhile.
