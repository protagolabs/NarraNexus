@description: Cross-user agent listing + create endpoint for Manyfold platform

Manyfold needs to:
  - Enumerate all agents in the container regardless of which NarraNexus
    user created them (GET /manyfold/agents).
  - Create a new NarraNexus user + agent when a Manyfold user creates an
    agent via the Manyfold UI (POST /manyfold/agents).

Registered only when ENABLE_MANYFOLD_API=1 (see backend/main.py). The
auth middleware requires a valid MANYFOLD_GATEWAY_TOKEN before the
handler runs.

Owner decision 2026-05-25: container is single-user in practice so the
cross-user concern is mostly cosmetic, but the platform contract still
expects "list everything" semantics — we honor it.
