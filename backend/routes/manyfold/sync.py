@description: Manyfold managed-trigger surface — config read endpoints,
config-change webhook middleware, and the run-job execution entry.

When NarraNexus runs on a Manyfold cloud sandbox, the sandbox suspends
while idle, so in-process pollers (job_trigger) and long-lived IM
connections (run_channel_triggers) cannot own scheduling or inbound IM.
run.sh skips both when NEXUS_EXTERNAL_TRIGGERS=1 and Manyfold takes over:

  - GET /manyfold/jobs / GET /manyfold/channels — Manyfold pulls the
    authoritative job + channel-binding state and mirrors it into its
    own scheduler (automations) and channel connections.
  - config_change_webhook_middleware — fire-and-forget POST to
    MANYFOLD_SYNC_WEBHOOK_URL after any successful config write, so
    Manyfold pulls immediately after a dashboard change.
  - execute_job_once / parse_run_job_control — Manyfold's mirrored alarm
    fires a chat turn whose prompt is `[[nx:run_job <job_id> v1]]`;
    openai_compat dispatches it here instead of a normal agent run.

Everything is inert without the MANYFOLD_* env (webhook no-ops) and the
routers are only registered when ENABLE_MANYFOLD_API=1 (backend/main.py),
so local / EC2 / DMG deployments behave exactly as before.
