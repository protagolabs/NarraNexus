@description: Backend proxy for NetMind billing/subscription API.

The user's NetMind loginToken lives in the frontend (configStore.netmindToken);
it is forwarded per-request via the ``X-Netmind-Token`` header and proxied to
NetMind's billing API. We never store or log the token — this layer only adds
the HTTP envelope, cloud gating, and error mapping (D-1: backend proxy).

Gated on the "power" axis, NOT the deployment/security axis. The public
catalog (/plans) gates on ``is_power_login_enabled()`` (cloud OR a local
deployment that opted into NetMind login). Every user-scoped endpoint gates on
``is_power_account(user_id)`` — the resolved user must be a NetMind
("individual") account. A pure-local username user therefore gets a clean 404,
while a Power user on a local install gets the full billing panel. We
deliberately do NOT gate on ``is_cloud_mode()``: that is the JWT security
regime, orthogonal to whether Power billing applies (see
``utils.deployment_mode`` "two orthogonal axes").

Phase 1 scope: GET /plans (public), GET /subscription (loginToken). Balance,
subscribe/cancel, and recharge land in later phases on the same proxy.

    NetMind's own result page, on a domain they have never seen (the 2026-07-30
    P0: "paid on NarraNexus, ended up on a stranger's site").

    The origin comes ONLY from deploy config (``settings.public_base_url``),

    influenceable by anything a caller can set, and the deploy value is already
    trusted — which also makes an allowlist redundant rather than a second line

    and the desktop app, whose front-end origin is ``tauri://localhost`` and
    therefore unreachable for Stripe anyway) keeps exactly today's behavior.

    Anything the upstream would choke on yields ``{}`` instead of a broken
    checkout. This is the load-bearing rule, and it is built on measurements
    (dev, 2026-07-30) rather than assumption, because guessing wrong here costs
    the user the ability to pay at all — never worth a cosmetic redirect:

    - A malformed URL makes the upstream answer 500 "Failed to create Stripe
      checkout session".
    - A loopback / private host is rejected by the upstream's EDGE with an HTML
      403 — for any scheme, `https://localhost` and `http://192.168.x.x` alike.
      Our client maps a 403 to BillingAuthError, which this route reports as
      401 "NetMind token invalid or expired", so sending one would break payment
      AND blame the user's login for it. Hence the host screen below; it also
      means a `bash run.sh` install cannot receive the redirect no matter what
