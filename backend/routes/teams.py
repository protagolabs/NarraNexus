#   * no member agent is the "channel owner", which in MessageBusTrigger is
#     always activated by any message — here delivery is purely @-mention
#     driven (the user @mentions agents; @all maps to the bus "@everyone").
# The user posts as the synthetic sender ``usr_<user_id>``. The standalone
# MessageBusTrigger picks the message up and runs the @mentioned agents; their
# replies post back into the same channel (see message_bus_trigger.py).

    """Clear a team's group-chat history and/or its shared files.

    The team counterpart to ``wipe_agent_data``: it clears the collaboration
    *surface* (the room's messages + the ``_shared/teams/{team_id}`` folder)
    but KEEPS the team, its members, and the bus channel + membership rows so
    the room keeps working. Owner scoping is enforced by the caller.

    - clear_chat: delete ``bus_messages`` (and their ``bus_message_failures``)
      for the team room channel (``created_by='team_<id>'``).
    - clear_files: delete the on-disk ``_shared/teams/{team_id}`` dir, its
      ``team_files`` index rows, AND this team's artifacts.

      The cascade to artifacts is not an over-reach — it became correct when
      registration started REQUIRING a team artifact to live in that folder.
      An earlier version of this docstring argued the opposite, on the grounds
      that a team artifact pointed into the producer's own workspace and
      survived; that was true then and is false now. Deleting the folder now
      destroys every team artifact's content, so leaving the rows behind would
      list artifacts whose files are gone. ``ArtifactService.heal`` does not
      rescue them either — not because it is team-blind (it is not; it scopes
      itself to the team folder), but because it only ever RECONNECTS a pointer
      to a file that still exists, and this deletes the files themselves.
    - clear_artifacts: delete this team's ``instance_artifacts`` rows and their
      attribution history WITHOUT touching the folder. Used when the TEAM
      itself goes away, and available on its own for dropping the tabs while
      keeping the files.
    - clear_bulletin: delete the team's standing rules and its auto-summary.
      Deliberately its OWN scope and not folded into ``clear_chat``: the
      bulletin exists precisely because it is not chat, so wiping the
      transcript must not take the rules with it — that would recreate the
      "say it again" loop the bulletin was built to end.
    - clear_board: delete the team's work items.

    The board is a SEPARATE scope rather than part of ``clear_chat``, because
    the two answer different questions: the chat is what was said, the board is
    what is still owed. A user clearing a noisy transcript usually still wants
    to know what the team is on the hook for — and a user abandoning the work
    should not have to wipe the history to do it.

    DB deletes commit first (source of truth); the disk delete runs after,
    best-effort, so a filesystem hiccup never rolls back the DB. Idempotent.
