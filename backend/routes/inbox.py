@description: Agent Inbox API — the record of conversations the user was not in

Endpoints:
  GET  /api/agent-inbox                          — list threads with messages
  PUT  /api/agent-inbox/{message_id}/read        — mark a single message read
  POST /api/agent-inbox/rooms/{room_id}/read     — mark a whole thread read

The room-level endpoint exists because the list caps each thread at 50
messages while `unread_count` is computed against ALL of them, so marking only
the latest VISIBLE message leaves any older-unread tail behind. Click-the-row
UX (2026-05-28) calls the room-level endpoint so the badge always disappears.

READS THE INBOX'S OWN TABLES (2026-08-17). It used to list every bus channel
the agent belonged to, which mixed three unrelated things into one panel — IM
conversations, agent-to-agent DMs, and team rooms that already have their own
UI — and made the panel's "mark read" button advance the SAME cursor the agent's
turn context is gated on. Clicking "read" in the panel changed what the agent
was handed next turn.

Now: `inbox_threads.last_read_at` is the USER's read state and touches nothing
the agent sees. Team rooms and the owner's own chat are deliberately absent —
the user is a live participant there and those surfaces carry their own unread
signal (`TeamWithMembers.last_message_at/preview/author`, and the chat window
itself). The rule is one sentence: the inbox is the conversations you were not
in.
