@description: Admin-only sensitive-operation user warning.

The progressive-response layer before hard enforcement: when the private
monitor decides a soft (unproven) signal warrants a nudge, it POSTs here to
push ONE generic warning to the user. Gated on the platform ``admin_secret_key``
via ``X-Admin-Secret`` — the SAME lock as suspend/reinstate; an executor or an
agent has no such secret.

Security shape (do not weaken):
  * The user-facing wording is a FIXED generic constant (``SENSITIVE_OP_WARNING``)
    written here regardless of any input, so no rule / threshold / evidence can
    leak to the user. The caller's ``category`` is OPAQUE and goes ONLY into the
    ban_audit trail, never into the user notification.
  * Best-effort dedup within ``_DEDUP_WINDOW_SEC``: a recent ``abuse_warning``
    for the same user short-circuits to ``already=True`` without a second row.
    This collapses a SEQUENTIAL retry (the caller re-POSTs after seeing/ not
    seeing a response). It is a read-then-write with no unique constraint behind
    it, so it is NOT atomic: two truly concurrent POSTs can both pass the check
    and both insert. That is an accepted cost here — the worst case is one
    duplicate generic warning notification, which is harmless (unlike a
    duplicate enforcement row); we do not pay for a unique index to prevent it.
