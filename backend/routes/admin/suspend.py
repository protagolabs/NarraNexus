@description: Admin-only account-suspension mechanism.

A generic, reusable switch over a user's account state, driven by a private
caller. This module holds NO policy: it does not decide who should be
suspended or why. It exposes three self-credentialed operations —

    POST /api/admin/suspend           set account state to suspended
    POST /api/admin/reinstate         return account state to active (and resume
                                      the jobs the suspension paused)
    GET  /api/admin/account-state/{user_id}   read current account state

— each gated on the platform ``admin_secret_key`` via an ``X-Admin-Secret``
header (never a user JWT, never open), exactly like migrate-identity. The
``reason`` and ``evidence_ref`` fields are OPAQUE free text recorded verbatim
in the ``ban_audit`` trail; this layer never interprets or categorises them.

    RUNNING and the auto-paused states are left as they are (review I1):
    reinstate restores what this pauses to ACTIVE, which would start a
    dependency-blocked job before its upstream finished.

    Runs in the same request as the `users.status` flip so a suspended
    account's scheduled jobs stop being enqueued immediately, instead of
    waiting for the job poller's own (separate) account check on its next
    cycle. It is deliberately the LAST step and wrapped (review I4): the
    account flip is the source of truth, the audit row and the cache
    invalidation must not be lost to a job-table hiccup, and the poller's
    per-job gate (`JobTrigger._non_transacting_status`) is the durable
    backstop for anything this misses. The count / error are surfaced in
    the response so a partial pause is never silent.

    One batched UPDATE selected by execution principal
    (`JobRepository.pause_jobs_for_execution_principal`, review I2/I3) —
    the identity the run would use, which is what the poller judges too.
    `paused_reason="banned"` marks these as never auto-resumable by the
    poller; `POST /api/admin/reinstate` is the way back and resumes exactly
    this population (`_resume_jobs_for_reinstated_principal`, review r2 I-B).

    Only called when THIS request moved the account into a suspended state.
    Re-suspending an account that is already non-transacting pauses nothing
    here; any of its jobs still live are caught by the poller's per-job gate
    on their next due cycle.
