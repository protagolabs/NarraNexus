@description: Internal admin endpoint that records an authoritative gateway-key
misuse event — the SOLE writer of gateway_key_misuse.

    POST /api/admin/gateway-key-misuse    record one gateway-key misuse event

Neutral / opaque by design: it stores a ``user_id`` that the caller already
AUTHORITATIVELY reverse-resolved for the offending key (the gateway is the
authority on which identity the key is bound to). This endpoint parses NO
free-form text for attribution — it records only the fields it is handed. Gated
on ``X-Admin-Secret`` (the same lock as suspend / migrate-identity), so only the
internal server-to-server path can write here; executor / agent hold no such
credential.

The written row is the payload, not an advisory note: the security monitor reads
gateway_key_misuse read-only to drive its response ladder. So the write goes
through the repository layer ([[gateway_key_misuse_repository]]) and a failure
surfaces (the row was not persisted), rather than being swallowed.
