@description: Shared gate for the self-credentialed admin routes.

The admin routes (identity migration, runtime status, account suspension) are
driven by a private operator or a headless watcher, NOT by a user JWT. They all
authenticate the same way: an ``X-Admin-Secret`` header compared against the
platform ``admin_secret_key``. This module is the ONE copy of that check, so the
three route modules cannot drift apart — a private helper module, exactly like
``backend/routes/artifacts/_token.py``.

STATUS-CODE CONTRACT (do not change without updating the deploy alert watcher):
  * 503 — no admin secret configured. A cloud-grade deployment with the feature
    ON but no secret set is a misconfiguration, not an open door; refuse rather
    than allow. The deploy-side alert watcher reads 503 as "feature off".
  * 403 — a missing or wrong header. Authenticated-but-not-permitted.

The compare is constant-time (``hmac.compare_digest``) so the header cannot be
recovered by timing the response.
