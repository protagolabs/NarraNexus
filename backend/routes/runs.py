@description: Run-level control plane — today: the owner's stop request.

Why a run-scoped route rather than a team-scoped one: run observability is
already a PLATFORM property (#219 — one recorder for every trigger run, one
observation endpoint for every reader). Stopping is the write-side twin of
that, so it keys off run_id and stays usable by any surface that can name a
run (team roster today, a runs dashboard later), not just team rooms.

This route only RECORDS intent. The run lives in another process (workers),
so the actual interruption is delivered there by CancelWatcher reading
``events.cancel_requested_at``. Recording and delivering are deliberately
separate: the click gets its answer in one round trip regardless of how
loaded the workers process is, which is the whole point of the feature —
the incident that motivated it was 8 minutes of silence, not a slow stop.

    A team task runs in public, so it should stop in public: without a trace the

    left guessing whether it finished, crashed, or is still going.

    Takes the WHOLE stopped set, not just the clicked run: a cascade silences
    every agent in the tree, and narrating only the one the owner happened to
    click leaves the others vanishing exactly as described above.

    ONE NOTICE PER AGENT, not one merged notice per room. Merging reads better
    in a busy room, but the name in the rendered line comes from the message's
    own sender (the transcript resolves ``from_agent`` to a display name, which
    is what makes the line localise correctly). A merged notice would have to
    carry the other names inside ``content`` — an English sentence the frontend
    would then have to scrape — because ``bus_messages`` has no structured
    metadata column to put a name list in. Two or three grey system lines is a
    smaller price than a scraped string, and each line stays attributable.

    Best-effort by design — the stop itself is already durable, and failing to
    narrate it must never turn a successful stop into a 500.
