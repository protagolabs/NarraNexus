@description: Backend HTTP twin of the ChannelCredentialStore seam (blueprint
P2, #2 "mcp zero db creds").

The credential endpoint is the ONLY route in the codebase that returns a raw
channel secret (each channel's own field — Discord ``bot_token``, Lark
``app_secret_encoded``, …), so all three endpoints here carry a DOUBLE gate:

  1. service gate — ``_require_service_caller`` requires
     ``request.state.nx_service_authed``, the flag ``auth_middleware`` sets ONLY
     after it VERIFIED the executor's broker-signed Ed25519 identity (fail-closed
     on forged/expired/mismatched). A plain user-session JWT, a local
     ``X-User-Id`` request, or any un-verified path is 403 — the panel masks
     credentials on purpose and the raw token must never leak back to a browser.
  2. owner gate — ``assert_owned`` on that proven identity (never a self-declared
     user id), so no cross-tenant read.

Endpoints (mounted under /api/agents by agents/core.py):
  GET /{agent_id}/channels/{channel}/credential  -> raw cred dict | {"bound": false}
  GET /{agent_id}/channels/name                  -> {"agent_name": str}
  GET /{agent_id}/channels/owner                 -> {"owner_user_id": str}

``channel`` is validated against ``SUPPORTED_CHANNELS`` (derived from the seam's
registry) BEFORE any lookup -> 404 otherwise, so this endpoint can never be used
to probe for channels that aren't wired.

Never logs the secret — the credential dataclasses' ``to_raw_dict()`` is the
only place the raw fields leave the manager, and this handler delegates to the
seam's DirectStore and passes the dict straight through, never touching fields.
