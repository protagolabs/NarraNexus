@description: Pure event_log -> timeline projection for the event-log route.

Lifted out of chat_history.py, which is well past the 800-line convention.
Everything here is a pure function over already-loaded rows: no DB, no request
context, so `tests/backend/test_event_log_monologue_tier.py` can feed it step
dicts directly instead of standing up a database.

    ``execution_state.record_thinking`` stores ``content`` (the coalesced
    DISPLAY stream) alongside ``monologue`` (the monologue SUBSET of it).

    A step where the subset is only PART of the content is unsplittable — the
    union and the subset are recorded, the positions are not. Since 2026-08-30
    the batcher flushes on a tier switch, so such a step can only come from a
    row persisted before that; the equality test stays as the guard that keeps
    the failure pointing the safe way if mixing is ever reintroduced. It
    reports False and renders as ordinary thinking: the failure that hides
    narration among CoT, never the one that promotes provider scratchpad or
    invents a boundary that was not recorded.

    Their original order IS the agent's actual think→tool→think→tool→reply
    rhythm, which the grouped thinking/tool_calls fields lose. Consecutive

    blocks — but only within one tier: a monologue/CoT switch is a block
    boundary, because one entry carries one tier flag and a merged block would
    label two tiers of text with one of them (see ``is_monologue_step``).

    ``call_names`` is the shared tool_call_id → name index built by the caller
    and read by both this view and the grouped tool_calls view.

    The tier carried here is what lets a RELOADED (ended) turn look like the
