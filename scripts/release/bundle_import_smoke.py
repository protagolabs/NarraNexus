@description: Import smoke test for a freshly populated interpreter — imports
              every sidecar entrypoint the desktop app launches and fails on
              ANY exception. Run by scripts/release/build-desktop.sh (step 3.1)
              with the BUNDLED interpreter, right after the dependencies land.

Assumes a POSIX bundle, because that is the only bundle we build (macOS dmg).
It matters for one name: `uvloop` is a conditional dependency in uv.lock
(`sys_platform != 'win32' and != 'cygwin'`, non-PyPy), so on a Windows bundle it
would be correctly absent and this script would fail on it. Whoever builds that
bundle should narrow the list by platform — NOT swallow the failure, which would
quietly drop httptools and websockets from the check as well.

# and NOTHING in src/ backend/ plugins/ packages/ imports it — uvicorn's
# websockets_impl is its only consumer. A broken wheel there does not raise; the
# server just logs "Unsupported upgrade request" per connection and the desktop
# app's chat WS is dead, with a green build behind it.
