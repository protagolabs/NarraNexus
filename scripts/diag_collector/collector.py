@description: Diagnostic log collector — the receiving end of the
observability push sink (utils/logging/_ship.py).

Runs on OUR ops hosts (staging sandboxes → NarraNexus-dev, prod →
xyz-algo), NOT inside any sandbox. TLS is terminated by the host's
existing caddy; this service listens on a local port behind it. Auth is
a static bearer token shared with the senders via env — service-to-
service HTTP, no SSH/pem involved (pem stays what HUMANS use to log in
and read the collected files).

Storage layout (grep-first: every record is one self-contained JSON
line with the envelope fields merged in):

    <DATA_DIR>/<env>/<runtime_id>/<service>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl

The <env> level is an ALLOWLIST, not a free value: labels outside
DIAG_COLLECT_KNOWN_ENVS collapse into the single "unknown" bucket at
write time (with a warning naming the demoted label — silent collapse
would let vocabulary drift rot our own data unnoticed), and the size
cap partitions by the env alone. Below the env level, directory
populations are bounded (256 runtimes / 16 services per parent; beyond
the cap new names land in an "overflow" bucket) purely as inode
hygiene — the segment values come from untrusted record fields.
Attribution survives regardless: every record keeps its envelope
fields inline.

Retention: files older than DIAG_COLLECT_RETENTION_DAYS (default 30)
are deleted by a daily sweep (startup + every 24h), which also removes
emptied directories bottom-up.

This is a PUBLIC telemetry endpoint by design (telemetry redesign,
2026-08-11): the sender codebase is open source, so a baked or shared
client secret authenticates nothing — security here is abuse control
(streaming size caps, gzip-bomb bounds, per-IP rate limits), not
secrecy. A spoofed envelope pollutes only our own diagnostics data.
``DIAG_COLLECT_TOKEN`` remains an optional knob for private
deployments; when set, requests must present it.

Env:
    DIAG_COLLECT_TOKEN            optional bearer; set → required on
                                  every request (private deployments)
    DIAG_COLLECT_CONFIG_JSON      optional JSON served verbatim at
                                  GET /telemetry/v1/config — the
                                  discovery document senders resolve
                                  ingest URLs from. Set it on EVERY
                                  collector that senders discover
                                  against: prod (agent.narra.nexus) is
                                  the built-in default, and the DEV
                                  collector (dev-agent) too, because
                                  run.sh points STAGING sandboxes there
                                  (they never read prod's document).
                                  Its keys are the side of the label
                                  contract that decides the RECEIVING
                                  HOST; a label missing here silently
                                  routes to "default". Absent entirely,
                                  /v1/config returns 404 and senders
                                  back off a full TTL.
    DIAG_COLLECT_KNOWN_ENVS       comma-separated env labels that get
                                  their own storage partition; default
                                  "staging,cloud,local,desktop,dev,
                                  sprite" (the sender label vocabulary
                                  + our dev cloud stack + non-staging
                                  manyfold sandboxes — their own
                                  partition, so a full-level sandbox
                                  fleet rotates itself under the size
                                  cap instead of crowding prod). FOUR-SIDED with
                                  the senders' NEXUS_DIAG_ENV, the
                                  discovery map above, and WHICH
                                  collector serves that map: this list
                                  only decides the STORAGE PARTITION,
                                  the map's keys decide the receiving
                                  host, and run.sh decides which
                                  collector a label discovers against
                                  (staging -> dev) — extend all four
                                  together.
                                  Anything else lands in unknown/
                                  with a warning
    DIAG_COLLECT_DATA_DIR         default ~/diag-collect
    DIAG_COLLECT_RETENTION_DAYS   default 30
    DIAG_COLLECT_MAX_DATA_GB      default 20 — HARD footprint cap: the
                                  collector deletes its own oldest
                                  files to stay under it. The host's
                                  disk can never fill because of
                                  telemetry; the worst an attacker
                                  achieves is rotating OUR buffer.
    DIAG_COLLECT_PORT             default 9880

Deployment (EXACT caddy directives — constraints in prose don't get
executed):

    handle_path /telemetry/* {
        request_body { max_size 8MB }
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:9880 {
            header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}
        }
    }

…and set DIAG_COLLECT_TRUST_REAL_IP=1 on the collector. Without the
flag the X-Real-IP header is IGNORED (a client can send it too — 
trusting it unconditionally re-opens the client-authored-identity hole
this design closed); the failure mode of a missed flag is then "rate
limit degrades to one global bucket", never "rate limit silently
bypassed".
