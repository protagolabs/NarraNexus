@description: One-shot cleanup — remove duplicate agent-scoped (pinned)
artifact rows that point at the same entry file, keeping the newest row.

Why this exists
    Before 2026-07-23 the LLM register_artifact path (which never knows a
    session_id -> agent-scoped, auto-pinned) minted a NEW pinned row every
    time an agent re-registered the same entry file without passing
    target_artifact_id. Each duplicate is a pinned tab that lives forever —
    prod showed two "Welcome to NarraNexus" tabs on one agent; dev had
    briefing pages pinned three times. Registration now dedupes in place
    (see artifact/_artifact_impl/registration.py), but the rows minted
    before that fix must be cleaned up once.

What it does
    Groups pinned rows by (agent_id, file_path); in every group with more
    than one row it keeps the newest (by created_at, artifact_id as
    tie-break) and deletes the rest. Registry-only: workspace files are
    never touched — all rows in a group point at the same entry file, which
    the surviving row keeps serving. Session-scoped rows are out of scope.

Idempotent & dual-backend safe
    After one apply run there are no groups left, so re-running is a no-op.
    Plain SQL, bare identifiers — runs on both SQLite and MySQL.

Usage on the EC2 host (inside the backend container):
    cd /app
    uv run python scripts/cleanup_duplicate_pinned_artifacts.py           # dry run
    uv run python scripts/cleanup_duplicate_pinned_artifacts.py --apply   # execute
