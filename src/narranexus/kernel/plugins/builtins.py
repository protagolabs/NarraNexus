@description: The host's own plugins, declared as manifests (D4: builtins are plugins too).

Explicit registration, not discovery (Python Packaging guide: explicit is
deterministic, greppable and fast): ``BUILTIN_PLUGINS`` is the ordered list of
(plugin id, package) pairs and the manifest of each is the plugin's own
``narranexus-plugin.json`` — read from the package (a wheel carries it) or the
source checkout. The kernel keeps no copy: a plugin's ``provides`` names its
``Contribution`` symbols and the loader registers exactly those at boot.
