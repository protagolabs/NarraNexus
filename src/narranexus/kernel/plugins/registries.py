@description: The ``Registries`` facade — one ``Registry`` per slot path, the hook registry, the slot tree.

Platform code takes its registries from here instead of building private
dicts, so "who provides what" is answerable in one place and the loader has a
single object to populate and freeze. The registry for a slot is created on
first request from the slot's own declaration (``Slot.kind`` gives the
contract version, ``Slot.case_insensitive`` the key normalisation) — there is
no path-keyed table beside the tree to keep in step with it.

``KERNEL_REGISTRIES`` is the process-wide instance; tests build their own
``Registries`` to load manifests into a clean slate.
