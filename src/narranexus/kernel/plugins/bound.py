@description: Reading the RESOLVED bindings at runtime — the seam that turns "which plugin fills this slot" from a snapshot file into the object a host actually uses. ``bound_provider`` answers with the plugin id (binding layer > slot default), ``bound_entry`` / ``bound_entries`` hand back the registry contributions of that provider (one-arity: exactly one; many-arity: filtered and ordered by the binding, else registration order).
