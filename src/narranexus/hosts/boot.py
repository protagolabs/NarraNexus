@description: Staged plugin boot for one host process (spec §9.2): builtins fail-fast, user plugins isolated, then freeze.

    stage1  builtins (declaration order)         a failure raises — a broken builtin must not boot
    stage2  user plugins (dependency order)      each isolated; total deadline; failures recorded on registry.json
            per plugin: synthetic package + deps finder → declarative contributions → tables registered
                        → activator learns its events → onStartup fired by the host when ready
    registries.freeze()

The boot marker is entered before stage 2 and exited by the host once it is
healthy (``BootReport.mark_healthy``). If a marker was left behind twice in
a row, ``registry.json`` flips to safe mode and this boot loads builtins
only. Everything the boot decides is returned in ``BootReport`` so the
factory page can show it; nothing is hidden in logs alone.
