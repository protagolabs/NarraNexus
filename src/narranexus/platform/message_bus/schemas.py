@description: Pydantic data models for the MessageBus service

Defines the core data structures used across all MessageBus implementations:
- BusMessage: A message sent within a channel
- BusChannel: A communication channel (group or direct)
- BusChannelMember: Channel membership with read/processed cursors
- BusAgentInfo: Agent registration and discovery metadata
