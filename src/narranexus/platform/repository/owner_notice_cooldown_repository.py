@description: The owner of `owner_notice_cooldowns` — the persisted "last time
we told this owner about this thing" behind the owner-facing SYSTEM_NOTICE
writers (message bus permanent-failure / no-reply notices).

The window itself is the WRITER's constant (e.g. the bus trigger's
``FAILURE_NOTIFY_COOLDOWN_SECONDS``); this layer only remembers when the last
notice landed, keyed per (agent, target, category), so that:

* a process restart does not forget every open window (the in-process dict it
  replaces re-notified on the first poll after every deploy);
* several trigger processes agree on one answer instead of each writing its
  own notice;
* a window opened by channel A never silences an unrelated failure on channel
  B — the old key collapsed every target of a category into one slot.

Plain class (not a ``BaseRepository`` subclass): composite key, two verbs, no
entity type worth naming. Dialect-safe by construction — ``get_one`` /
``insert`` / ``update`` only, no hand-written SQL.
