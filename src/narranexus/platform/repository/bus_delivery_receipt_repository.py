@description: The owner of `bus_delivery_receipts` — the per-(message,
recipient) delivery ledger a bus sender can be shown.

A bus send used to be a fire-and-forget insert: "success" meant the row
existed, and everything after — the recipient's trigger crashing on it three
times, or its turn coming back empty — was visible only in the recipient
OWNER's inbox. The sender agent, which had just promised its user that work
was under way, learned nothing (upstream NetMindAI-Open/NarraNexus#106).

The receipt is one row per (message_id, to_agent), updated in place as the
message moves through its life:

    accepted   send tool: queued, recipient reachable
    held       send tool: queued, but the recipient's circuit breaker is
               paused/cooling — it will not run until that clears
    processed  trigger: the turn ran and reached someone (peer reply / tool)
    relayed    trigger: the turn produced owner-facing text only — the
               recipient relayed to ITS owner, the sender got no reply
    silent     trigger: the turn ran and reached nobody
    failed     trigger: the turn raised (retry pending; `attempts` counts)
    dropped    trigger: poison threshold reached, no more retries

`content_key` is the sha256 of the message content the recipient's turn was
built from. It exists for one question — "has this recipient ALREADY gone
silent on this exact content in this channel?" — which is how the trigger
tells a resend from a fresh message and stops waking the sender a second time
for the same silence (the 8/31 "This turn ended without delivering a reply"
ping-pong).

Plain class (composite key, upsert + two reads); dialect-safe by construction —
`get_one` / `get` / `insert` / `update` only, no hand-written SQL.
