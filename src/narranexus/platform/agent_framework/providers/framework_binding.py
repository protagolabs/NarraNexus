@description: Which provider protocols a slot accepts, and whether the agent slot's framework can actually redeem a given card.

These are business rules, not schemas: they read the framework registry
(``turn.pipeline.act.framework``) to answer "can this framework drive this
card?". They used to live in ``platform/schema/provider_schema.py`` and
reached UP into ``agent_framework`` through function-body imports, which
inverted the declared one-way stack (``api → runtime → service → impl →
repository → schema``) and hid the inversion from import-linter (a static AST
gate cannot see an import inside a function body). Here the imports are
top-level and the direction is right; ``provider_schema`` keeps only the
enums and pydantic models.

Error contract at this boundary: an unknown OR uninstalled framework raises
``ValueError`` so the provider routes' existing ``ValueError → 400`` mapping
applies. The settings page must stay renderable — it is the ONE place a user
can undo a binding to a framework they since uninstalled, so answering that
page with a 500 would remove the only recovery path. The raw
``FrameworkNotInstalledError`` stays on the TURN path
(``get_agent_loop_driver``), where it is the actionable message. This is NOT
"unknown framework → default": the binding is refused, never substituted.
