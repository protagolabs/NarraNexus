@description: Platform-side accessors for services builtins expose (skills workspace, job instances, run-once).

Thin wrappers over ``KERNEL_REGISTRIES.services`` + ``contracts.services``
so the bundle importer, marketplace, skill sync, onboarding and Arena
provisioning never name a builtin module.

The services are registered by the manifest loader when the HOST BOOTS — that
is the only registration path; importing this module, or the providing plugin,
registers nothing. A process that did not boot therefore has an EMPTY locator,
and that case is deliberately indistinguishable from "the owning builtin is
disabled in this distribution": both raise ``UnknownEntry`` from ``require``,
loudly and at the call site. Callers that have a degraded path use the ``try_*``
variants and get ``None``.
