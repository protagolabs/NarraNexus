@description: Plugin boot for the agent-side processes (mcp module servers, workers supervisor).

Health is NOT declared here. ``BootReport.mark_healthy`` clears the boot-crash
counter and moves the last-known-good snapshot, so it may only fire once the
process actually serves — these hosts call ``mark_host_healthy(role)`` from
their entrypoint after the server / supervisor is up. Marking it at the end of
``boot()`` meant a process that booted the plugins and then died before serving
still advanced the rollback target, which is precisely the state safe mode
exists to escape.

These hosts register declarative contributions only: tools, MCP servers,
skills, workers. They never activate user plugin code (activation needs the
backend's context: settings store, service locator, event bus) and never
register plugin tables (the backend owns migrations). The boot marker is per
role, so an mcp crash loop flips safe mode for mcp without touching the
backend's counter.
