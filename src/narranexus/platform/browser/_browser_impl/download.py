@description: Resolve where the browser runtime comes from, and fetch it resumably.

Two requirements here are about real users rather than about correctness in
the abstract:

**The mirror host must be overridable.** Local-mode users in mainland China
are the main population for this product, not an edge case (design §8.3). If
the download host cannot be pointed somewhere they can reach, the browser
feature simply does not exist for them. The override is therefore a first
class argument, not an afterthought — and it is refused unless it is HTTPS,
because a plain-http mirror lets anyone on the path swap the binary we are
about to execute.

**Resume is not optional.** A ~150 MB download over a flaky link that restarts
from zero every attempt never finishes. The fetch loop range-requests from
whatever is already on disk, and every failure path leaves the partial file
intact so the next attempt gains from it.

The HTTP layer is injected as ``source`` so both concerns can be tested
deterministically and so the transport can change without touching this logic.
