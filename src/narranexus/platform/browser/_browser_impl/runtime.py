@description: Detect whether the in-app browser runtime (Chromium) is usable.

The runtime is NOT shipped in the dmg (Owner decision 2026-09-22): the user
installs it once from the UI, the way Claude Code / Codex handle their own
runtime dependencies. Every entry point that needs a browser therefore has to
ask "is it there?" first, and three of them branch on the answer:

  * the agent-facing MCP tools — absent means ``NEEDS_HUMAN``, never a raw
    error the user cannot act on;
  * ``UrlRenderer``'s ``stream`` branch — absent renders the install card
    instead of a blank canvas;
  * ``hook_data_gathering`` — so the agent knows before it tries.

Two deliberate choices:

**Presence on disk is not readiness.** A half-extracted download and a
Gatekeeper-quarantined binary both leave a file that cannot start. We only
report ``ready`` when a ``--version`` probe actually answered, because the
alternative failure (a blank panel, no diagnosis) is the one users cannot
get themselves out of.

**Nothing here is cached.** The status is recomputed per call: the user can
delete the runtime between two uses, and a stale ``ready`` would send the
next call into the same undiagnosable blank panel.
