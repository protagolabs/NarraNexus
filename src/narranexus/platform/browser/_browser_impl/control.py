@description: Who is driving the browser right now — the agent, or the user (design §8.4).

The panel is interactive (Owner decision 2026-09-22: 看 + 接管), so two parties
can reach the same browser. Three rules make that safe rather than chaotic:

**One driver at a time, and the UI can always name them.** Codex does this by
showing a distinct agent cursor; we expose ``holder`` so the panel can say it.

**Handover is explicit, never a grab.** Stray mouse movement over the panel
does not steal the pointer — an agent halfway through filling a form would
otherwise leave a half-submitted one behind.

**A queued agent is a working agent.** While the user holds control the
agent's actions *wait*; they do not fail. This is 铁律 #14 applied to a case
that looks different but is not: turning "a human picked up the mouse" into a
tool error would make the user's own helpfulness look like a malfunction, and
would also put a ceiling on how long a takeover may last. There is
deliberately no timeout here.
