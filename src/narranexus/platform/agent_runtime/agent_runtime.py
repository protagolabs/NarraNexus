@description: Agent execution flow orchestrator

AgentRuntime is essentially an Orchestrator, responsible for coordinating the entire Agent execution flow.
It uses various services through dependency injection, keeping the orchestration logic clean.

Architecture:
- AgentRuntime is only responsible for flow orchestration (step sequence control)
- Specific work is delegated to injected services:
    - ExecutionState: State management
    - ResponseProcessor: Response processing
- File logging is owned by utils.logging.setup_logging(), called once
  per process at startup. AgentRuntime does NOT manage per-run sinks
  any more — the previous LoggingService leaked file descriptors on
  EC2 (see M4 / T15 in the log-system overhaul) and was removed.
- The concrete implementation of each Step is in the _agent_runtime_steps/ directory
