@description: AgentRuntimeClient — the single seam every trigger uses to
run an agent, instead of constructing AgentRuntime in-process.

Why this exists
---------------
Every trigger (channels, jobs, message-bus, chat A2A) runs agents
through this one interface, ``AgentRuntimeClient``, with two methods
that cover the two consumer shapes present in the code:

* ``run_and_collect`` — drive a run to completion and return a
  ``RunCollection`` (the ``run_collector.collect_run`` consumers:
  lark / slack / telegram / job / message-bus / chat-A2A-sync).
* ``run_stream`` — yield runtime events live (the streaming consumers:
  chat-A2A-SSE, matrix). The backend WS path uses BackgroundRun, not
  this client.

Both methods forward ``**extra_kwargs`` verbatim to ``AgentRuntime.run``,
so newer optional parameters (e.g. ``silent=True`` for skip-agent-loop
memory-only writes; ``trigger_extra_data`` for per-turn context) reach
the runtime without a signature bump here. Callers pass them as regular
keyword arguments to ``run_and_collect`` / ``run_stream``.

Run observability (2026-07-31)
------------------------------
This seam is also where every trigger run becomes OBSERVABLE: a
``RunRecorder`` taps the event stream (decorator around the runtime —
``_RecordedRuntime`` — so ``collect_run`` stays untouched) and persists
the same live trace the WS path produces via BackgroundRun:
``event_stream`` rows + the ``events`` row state machine + heartbeat.
Any read-side surface (chat reconnect endpoint's tail-follow, the team
roster, a future dashboard) can then observe a trigger run exactly like
a chat run. The recorder is an observer — its failures never break the
run — and can be disabled with ``NARRANEXUS_RUN_RECORDING_DISABLED``.

Transports:

* ``InProcessAgentRuntimeClient`` — calls ``AgentRuntime`` in the same
  process. Used by local / desktop (binding rule #7: bash run.sh and
  the DMG must not change), and by cloud until the dedicated
  agent-runtime service exists.
* (future) ``HttpAgentRuntimeClient`` — calls the extracted
  agent-runtime service over the network. The recorder moves with the
  transport (server-side), so triggers never change again (binding
  rule #9: the transport underneath can be swapped without rewriting
  callers).
