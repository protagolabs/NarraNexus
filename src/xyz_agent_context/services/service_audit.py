@description: Reusable L2 observability helper for background loops.

A long-running loop wires one ``ServiceAuditor``:

    audit = ServiceAuditor("job_trigger")
    await audit.started({"poll_interval": 5})
    while running:
        await do_work()
        await audit.heartbeat({"enqueued_total": n})   # throttled, cheap
    await audit.stopped()

Lifecycle events (started/stopped/error) write immediately;
``heartbeat()`` is throttled (default 60s) so a 5s poll loop does not
spam the DB, and carries cumulative work counters so a *stale* heartbeat
(old row, frozen counter) distinguishes "loop wedged" from "loop idle
but alive". All writes are best-effort and never raise into the caller —
the observer must not break the observed. See
``repository/service_audit_repository`` for the rationale.

The DB client is lazily acquired on first write via ``get_db_client()``
so constructing a ServiceAuditor at import/init time is free and safe.
