@description: SteerChannel — the orchestrator's push handle for a live run.

The orchestrator registers one of these in the RunRegistry when it starts a
steerable run and keeps it; when a new message arrives for that run it calls
``push``. The channel renders the injection to a provider message and enqueues
it on a plain asyncio.Queue.

Two deliveries, one channel:
* **in-process** (the loop runs in this process) — the loop's
  ``QueueSteeringInlet`` is built over THIS channel's ``queue``, so a push is
  already where the loop drains: no pump, no copy.
* **subprocess / remote** — the driver runs a small pump that drains the
  channel and writes each message down the runner's steer transport (a stdin
  line locally, the executor's steer endpoint in the cloud); the runner feeds
  its own inlet. That pump lives with the driver, added when the transport is.

``render_injection`` is the single place a ``SteerInjection`` becomes a
provider message. The tag names the source so the model reads a teammate's
room message differently from the owner interjecting — same mechanism,
different wording — while the injected message stays a plain ``user`` message
(append-only, cache-safe).
