@description: Shared collection helper for consumers of AgentRuntime.run().

Historically each trigger (LarkTrigger, JobTrigger, MessageBusTrigger,
ChatTrigger A2A) wrote its own ``async for msg in runtime.run(...)``
loop. That caused two bugs:

  1. Each loop only handled ``MessageType.AGENT_RESPONSE`` — ``ERROR``
     messages were silently dropped (Bug 2 surface symptom on Lark).
  2. Each loop re-implemented the same "accumulate deltas / track
     tool calls / capture raw payloads" logic slightly differently.

This module provides a single ``collect_run`` helper that reads every
message type once and returns a structured ``RunCollection``. Each
trigger only has to implement its own policy for displaying / logging
the error when ``result.is_error`` is true. A new trigger (Telegram,
Slack, Discord, ...) can adopt the same pattern with zero risk of
re-introducing the silent-drop bug.

Used by:
  - module/lark_module/lark_trigger.py (LarkTrigger._build_and_run_agent)
  - module/job_module/job_trigger.py (JobTrigger)
  - message_bus/message_bus_trigger.py (MessageBusTrigger)
  - module/chat_module/chat_trigger.py (ChatTrigger A2A handler)

Not used by the WebSocket route (``backend/routes/websocket.py``): that
path streams messages to the frontend live instead of collecting them,
and the frontend already knows how to render every message type.

            (e.g. show a friendlier text for
            ``LLMConfigNotConfigured`` than for a generic CLI crash).
        error_message: Human-readable explanation. May be surfaced to
            the owner in web chat verbatim, or replaced by a friendlier
            text for IM channels where the sender is not the owner.
        severity: What the failure means for the turn's OUTPUT. FOUR values,
            and a consumer that knows only two will discard a correct answer
            or announce a failure that did not happen:
            ``"fatal"`` — the turn has no usable output.
            ``"recoverable"`` — a transient provider hiccup the loop absorbed;
            it kept going and produced a real reply.
            ``"recovered"`` — a fatal-class failure the helper-LLM fallback
            papered over with a real reply.
            ``"recovered_after_reply"`` — the agent had already spoken when
