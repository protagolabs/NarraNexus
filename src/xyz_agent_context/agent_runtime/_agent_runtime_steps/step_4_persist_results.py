    implementation is what stops them from ever disagreeing — and a
    disagreement here is nasty to find, because the symptom is an audit
    probe silently skipping part of the traffic while its numbers look fine.

    Owner-visible specifically: the owner-facing tool this source's desk
    carries — ``reply_owner`` on owner chat, ``notify_owner`` everywhere else,
    plus the per-channel reply tools like ``lark_cli`` for IM sources. A bus
    reply to a peer agent is a delivery, but no human read it, so it must not
    re-anchor the owner's session (see
    MessageSourceHandler.owner_visible_reply_tool_names) and it is not
    something to measure human-facing accuracy against.

    Imports the channel registry (not any concrete Module) on purpose —
    Modules stay hot-pluggable (铁律 #3); the registry is shared infra.
    On any shape/registry mismatch we return `[]`, which reads as "nothing
    delivered": the background-delivery anchor is skipped and the guard runs

    Value-identical to the hand-rolled loop this used to be — that loop
    returned True on the first truthy `extract_owner_visible_text` and False
    otherwise, which is exactly `bool()` of the list above — with ONE
    documented exception, so nobody reads the equivalence as unconditional:

    the old loop short-circuited on the first hit and so never touched later
    elements. The list version walks the whole response, so a malformed
    element AFTER a real reply now sends the traversal down its `except` and
    flips this predicate from True to False. That is deliberate: "we could
    not read the response cleanly" resolves to "treat as not delivered",

        # belongs, so a neighbouring thread can still replay this exchange via
        # `select_events_for_context`. `events.narrative_id` stays single-valued
        # and names the one thread the turn was authored into.

        # (`EventService.duplicate_event_for_narrative`, since deleted). The copy
