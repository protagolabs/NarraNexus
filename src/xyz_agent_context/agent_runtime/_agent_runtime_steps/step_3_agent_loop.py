    Why this exists separately from the streaming/persistence paths:
    the fallback LLM needs a compact, ordered snapshot of "what
    happened this turn so far" so it can write a recovery reply that
    references the work the agent actually completed. The live stream
    is too noisy (every text delta is its own frame); the persisted
    form (chat_module) is too lossy (only the final assistant message
    survives).

    Contract:
      - Frames render in their original order (causal sequence matters).
      - Each entry is capped at ``max_per_entry`` bytes; truncation
        gets a ``[truncated N bytes]`` marker.
      - Total output is capped at ``max_total`` bytes; if exceeded,
        oldest entries drop FIRST (with a ``[... earlier activity
        omitted ...]`` marker prepended) — recent activity is what the
        recovery reply needs.
      - Adjacent ``AgentTextDelta`` frames are concatenated into one
        ``[assistant_text]`` block (matching how the frontend renders
        them) so the LLM sees coherent text instead of a delta soup.
      - Frames with no useful payload (structural ProgressMessages

      2. A synthetic ``ProgressMessage`` (one) tagging the fallback as

         persistence (chat_module) records it as a normal turn. Carries

    Why the ErrorMessage comes LAST: the frontend reduces
    ``responseParts`` from synthetic tool calls and falls back to
    ``currentErrors`` only when no responseParts exist. If we yielded
    ErrorMessage first, ``displayContent`` would briefly flip to the
    error string before the synthetic send_message lands — half a
    second of "system broke" UX even when we recovered cleanly.
