@description: Fast-mode replacement for step_1 — anchor-first narrative pick, no LLM.

Fast mode must reach the agent loop without paying step_1's synchronous
LLM round trip (ContinuityDetector + the retrieval LLM tier). This step
keeps the narrative "cheaply present" instead of bypassing it. No LLM
ever runs here.

Selection order mirrors the full path's continuity-first shape:

* A live session anchor (``session.current_narrative_id``, durable chat
  surfaces only) is reused by default — regardless of age, per the
  2026-05-20 session-timeout removal (narrative/config.py) — and a BM25
  top-1 may steal the turn away from it only above the strong
  ``FAST_ANCHOR_OVERRIDE_FLOOR``. Raw BM25 scales with query length, so
  short follow-ups stay in their thread while a long, topic-rich message
  can still switch.
* With a live anchor the fast path never CREATES a narrative — a
  measured decision, not an oversight: BM25 cannot separate "new topic"
  from "elliptical continuation" in CJK (numbers on
  ``FAST_ANCHOR_OVERRIDE_FLOOR`` in narrative/config.py), and a
  misfiled turn is recoverable (next full-path turn re-routes) while a
  fragmented thread is not. New threads arrive anchorless, via a strong
  override onto an existing thread, or from the next full-path turn.
* Without a live anchor, BM25 top-1 above the noise floor picks the
  background directly.

What happens on a full miss is the surface's call, carried by
``TurnProfile.narrative_persistence``:

* ``"ephemeral"`` (voice, F28): the turn runs bare — no creation, no
  session writes — so a normal follow-up message continuity-checks
  exactly as if the voice turn never happened.
* ``"durable"`` (persisted human chat surfaces): the miss falls through
  to a CRUD-only narrative creation, and the session continuity anchor
  is kept consistent on hit, reuse and create alike. A fast chat turn
  must never vanish from history — both history endpoints are
  narrative-scoped, and step_4 persists nothing for a bare turn.

Every decision leaves a RoutingAudit row (best-effort) with
``selection_method="fast"`` — same evidence contract as the full
select(), so routing/latency questions are answerable from the DB.

What it still MUST do on every pick: ensure the user's ChatModule
instance on the narrative (chat history assembly and turn persistence
both hang off that instance — skipping it would silently break memory).
