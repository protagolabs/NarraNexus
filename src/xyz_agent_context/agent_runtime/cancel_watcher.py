@description: Cross-process delivery of "stop this run" to the token holder.

A CancellationToken only reaches the run that owns it, in the process that
owns it. Chat stop works because the frontend, the token and the run share
one backend process (websocket.py holds them in app.state.active_runs).
Bus-driven runs live in the workers process, which the HTTP request never
enters — so the stop request travels through the DB instead
(``events.cancel_requested_at``), and this watcher is the piece that reads
it on the far side and fires the local token.

DB as the medium is the house style for cross-process run facts: the
liveness heartbeat, the stale sweep and the observation endpoint's
tail-follow all mediate through ``events`` rather than talking to each
other. An internal control port on the workers process was the alternative
and loses on multi-process topology, service discovery and auth.

    One instance per process (see ``get_cancel_watcher``), holding
    ``{run_id: token}``. Every tick is a single batched query over the
    registered ids — not one query per run — so a process driving N
    concurrent runs still costs one round trip per second.

    Deliberately NOT part of RunRecorder. The recorder's contract is to be a
    pure observer that can never affect the run it records (binding rule
    #14); this class exists to stop runs. Same table, opposite mandate —
    folding them together would put an interruption path inside the
    component whose guarantee is that it never interrupts.

    **Event-loop affinity**: ``CancellationToken`` wraps an ``asyncio.Event``,
    which is only safe within the loop that created it. Both the poll task and
    the tokens must therefore belong to one loop — true for every caller today
    (the trigger registers from the same loop it runs the agent on). A future
    caller driving runs on a second loop needs its own watcher instance there.
