@description: Idle-cull coordinator for per-user Executor containers.

Pure coordinator (dependency-injected): it owns neither the concurrency
state nor the docker transport. It periodically asks the admission
controller which users have gone idle past the TTL, and asks a ``stop_fn``
(the broker client) to stop them. This keeps the concerns separate:
  - AgentAdmissionController — concurrency + idle bookkeeping
  - ExecutorReaper          — WHEN to cull (this file)
  - run_recorder.first_live_run_id — IS the user actually idle (DB truth)
  - broker_client.stop_executor — HOW to stop (docker transport)

Binding rule #14: only idle executors are ever reaped — a running loop is
never interrupted. The cull just delays the next start by a cold boot,
surfaced to the user via the "waking up" UX.

That guarantee needs the third collaborator, and used to be stated
without it. The admission controller is a PER-PROCESS singleton while
executor containers are shared per USER, so "zero active loops" only ever
meant "zero in the process asking". The cloud orchestrator runs as
backend + workers and this reaper only runs in backend, so every run
driven by workers (group chat / message bus, scheduled jobs, channel
triggers) was invisible to it — and on 2026-07-31 it stopped the
container out from under a live group-chat reply, surfacing to the user
as ``infra_transient``. The idle claim is therefore vetoed by a
cross-process liveness check against the ``events`` table, which every
process writes to (incident lesson #5).

That check has a second consumer, which is why it is a module-level
function here rather than a private of the reaper: the broker's stale-image
replacement destroys the same container for a different reason, and asking
the same question two ways is how the two answers drift apart. See
``no_live_recorded_run_for``.

def reaper_status() -> dict:
    """L2 health of the idle-cull reaper, for the admin runtime snapshot.

    Answers the question the ``cull_skipped_busy`` metric cannot: culling
    stopping entirely looks exactly like nothing needing to be culled. The
    fail-safe paths (recording kill switch on, DB unreadable) make EVERY user
    read as busy, so a blind reaper reaps zero forever and is otherwise
    indistinguishable from a healthy idle system — until executors pile up to
    the broker's cap and new users start getting refused.

    Read it in this order — the first two are L2, the counts are only
    meaningful once they pass (incident lesson #4: "the task still exists" is
    L1 and proves nothing):

    * ``stale`` — no pass completed in 3 intervals. The counts below are
      frozen at whatever the last good pass saw, so a wedged reaper otherwise
      reports healthy numbers forever.
    * ``task_error`` — the background task died. Its only other trace is one
      log line at death, which the next log rotation eats.
    * ``veto_installed`` — false means this process is culling on its local
      view alone, i.e. the 2026-07-31 configuration, and it is reported
      rather than hidden. None means no pass has reported yet — distinct from
      false on purpose, since "we do not know" and "there is no guard" call
      for opposite reactions.
    * ``blind_passes`` — consecutive passes in which nothing could be judged.
      Non-zero and climbing means nothing is reclaiming executors here.
      EDGE-cleared, not level-cleared: only a pass that judges someone
      successfully resets it, because a pass with no candidates carries no
      information either way. Read it together with ``stale`` — the counter
      standing still can mean "recovered and nobody is due" or "no pass has
      run at all", and only ``stale`` separates those.

    The key set is the SAME on every path, including before the first pass
    has completed — which is every process's first ``interval_seconds`` after
    a deploy, and forever in a process with no broker. A consumer indexing
    ``blind_passes`` must not get a KeyError in exactly the window someone is
    watching a deploy. Unknowns are None (``stale``, ``veto_installed``);
    counts that are genuinely zero are 0.

    hand to ``ensure_executor`` as ``allow_stale_replace``.

    Named for the evidence, not for the conclusion. An earlier name said
    "replacement is safe", which promises more than this can see: it knows
    about runs in the ``events`` table and nothing else. Anything else living
    on that container is invisible here —

      * office-watch proxy sessions (``backend/routes/office_watch/proxy.py``)
        run ``officecli watch`` INSIDE the container and stream from it; a
        replacement takes the watch process and its port with it
      * anything future that holds the container without recording a run

    and the question a caller turns this into is about the CONTAINER, not
    about itself: "nothing else of MINE is on it" does not exclude another
    subsystem's session. No caller can establish that today, so every caller
    that passes this is accepting a residual risk. It is currently acceptable
    only because the idle cull already destroys such a container on its TTL;
    the fix is to give non-run holders a lease row that
    ``live_run_elsewhere`` reads, which removes the risk for every consumer
    at once instead of per caller.

    Second consumer of the liveness answer above, and it lives here so there
    is ONE place that asks "is anyone using this container?". The alternative
    is a second running-plus-heartbeat query elsewhere, whose staleness rule
    drifts from this one the first time either is touched.

    The broker cannot answer this itself and should not learn how: it is the
    one component with docker access, and its threat model rests on having
    exactly one caller-controlled input (a user_id it validates). Handing it
    DB credentials to look up run state would widen that surface for a fact
    the orchestrator already holds.

    ``active_run_id`` is the asking run's own id, excluded from the answer:
    at ensure() time the caller's events row is already ``running`` but it
    has not connected to the container yet, so counting itself would mean
    "never replace" — and a stale executor after a wire-protocol change
    degrades runs silently (2026-07: an old executor got an EMPTY MCP set).

    Deliberately conservative: a live run of the same user may not be using
    the executor at all (not yet at step 3, or a direct-trigger run that
    never does). Deferring costs one more turn on old code and self-corrects
    at the next ensure; replacing under a live run kills it (rule #14).
