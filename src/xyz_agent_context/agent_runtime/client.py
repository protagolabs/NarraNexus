@description: AgentRuntimeClient — the single seam every trigger uses to
run an agent, instead of constructing AgentRuntime in-process.

Why this exists
---------------
Today every trigger (channels, jobs, message-bus, chat A2A) and the
backend WS route build ``AgentRuntime()`` and drive ``.run()`` directly.
That means the agent_loop — and the claude/codex subprocess it spawns —
runs inside *every* trigger container, so the 2026-06-17 security
exposure (env dump / cross-workspace read) has 8 attack surfaces, not
one.

This module introduces one interface, ``AgentRuntimeClient``, with two
methods that cover the two consumer shapes already present in the code:

* ``run_and_collect`` — drive a run to completion and return a
  ``RunCollection`` (the ``run_collector.collect_run`` consumers:
  lark / slack / telegram / job / message-bus / chat-A2A-sync).
* ``run_stream`` — yield runtime events live (the streaming consumers:
  backend WS via BackgroundRun, chat-A2A-SSE).

Transports:

* ``InProcessAgentRuntimeClient`` — calls ``AgentRuntime`` in the same
  process. Behaviour-identical to today. Used by local / desktop
  (binding rule #7: bash run.sh and the DMG must not change), and by
  cloud until the dedicated agent-runtime service exists.
* (future) ``HttpAgentRuntimeClient`` — calls the extracted
  agent-runtime service over the network. Selecting it for cloud is the
  next step; this file is the seam so triggers never change again
  (binding rule #9: the transport underneath can be swapped without
  rewriting callers).
