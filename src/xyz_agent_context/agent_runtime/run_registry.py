@description: RunRegistry — the per-process index of live runs by
(agent_id, surface), the routing brain for live steering.

A producer that has a new message for an agent asks "is this agent already
running on THIS surface?". If yes, the message is steered into that run
(appended to its context at the next step boundary) instead of dispatching
a fresh turn. Surface-scoping is the whole point: one agent may have several
concurrent runs — multiple team rooms, a web chat, a job — and a message for
one surface must NEVER route into a run on a different surface (that would
splice a team-A message into a team-B turn's context).

Why per-process, in-memory, not a DB table: a run's steer handle (the live
push into its loop) only exists in the process that owns the run, and for the
v1 producers the producer is co-located with its target run — a team message
and the team run are both in the bus-trigger process; an owner-chat
interjection and the web run are both in the backend process. So the process
that produces is the process that holds the run. This is a seam (iron rule
#20, like ``get_admission_controller``): the interface stays the same if a
future cross-process producer needs the truth moved behind Redis / a DB view.

``run_id`` is opaque here and to ``steer_inbox``: whoever registers a run
mints the handle (it need not be the late-bound ``events.event_id``), and the
registry never interprets it.
