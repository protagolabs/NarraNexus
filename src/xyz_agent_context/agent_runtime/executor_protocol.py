@description: Wire format for the agent-loop executor boundary.

The agent-loop (step 3 of the 7-step pipeline) is the ONLY place that
spawns the claude/codex CLI. Extracting it into a separate "executor"
service means that boundary must be crossed over the network instead of
an in-process call. This module is the shared (de)serialization for that
boundary, used by BOTH ends:

  * orchestrator side: ``RemoteAgentLoopDriver`` builds the request
    (incl. a snapshot of the resolved provider configs, which normally
    travel via ContextVar and therefore would NOT survive a network hop).
  * executor side: ``executor_service`` rebuilds the configs, re-applies
    them via ``api_config.set_user_config``, runs the LOCAL driver, and
    streams raw event dicts back.

Keeping this in the core package (not backend/) so both the executor
service entrypoint and the driver can import it without a backend dep.

# handle names a resource OUTSIDE the request, living in a CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR

# guessed handle plus a guessable working_path would replay another tenant's

# transcript itself, inside the executor, and deletes it when the turn ends —
