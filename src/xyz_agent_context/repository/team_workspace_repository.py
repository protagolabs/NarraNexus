@description: Data access for the two tables the team workspace introduced.

Why these exist rather than raw SQL at each call site
-----------------------------------------------------
Both tables were being queried by hand from wherever they were needed:
`team_files` from the MCP tool, the staging path and the teams route;
`instance_artifact_history` written from inside `_artifact_impl/` by reaching
through `ArtifactRepository._db` — a private attribute, from another layer.

Beyond the project convention that every table gets a repository, this is the
mechanism that keeps DIALECT risk in one place. Hand-written SQL scattered
across three modules is three chances to write something SQLite accepts and
MySQL rejects; `tests/message_bus/test_team_workspace_mysql.py` exists because
that has happened before in this codebase.

These carry raw SQL rather than subclassing `BaseRepository`'s entity plumbing:
neither table has a Pydantic model, and both are read as plain dicts by their
consumers (a listing endpoint and a chip lookup). Adding entities purely to
satisfy the base class would be ceremony without a reader.
