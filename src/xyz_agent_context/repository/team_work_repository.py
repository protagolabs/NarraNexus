@description: Data access for the team work board.

Lives here rather than inside the message-bus module because repositories are
project-wide by convention (``repository/``, never inside a module) — and this
one has two consumers that are not the module: the patrol lane in
``MessageBusTrigger`` and the cancel endpoint's stop→pause link.

        Board order is `created_at, id`. `created_at` alone is not deterministic

        MySQL gets `DATETIME(6)` — so two items added in the same second would
        come back in whatever order the engine felt like, and SQLite is the
