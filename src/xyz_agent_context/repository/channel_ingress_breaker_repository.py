@description: Data access for the message-ingress circuit breaker.

CRUD over ``channel_ingress_breaker`` (one row per session key
``agent_id|channel|chat_id|sender_id``). ``IngressGuard`` owns every escalation
decision; this layer only reads and writes rows — the same split as
``AgentCircuitBreakerRepository`` and its breaker service.

Read volume is deliberately tiny: the guard reads a key ONCE (lazily, on
the first message it sees for that key after process start) and writes only
on tier transitions. The hot path — every inbound message — never touches
this repository.

        """Delete CLOSED rows (``tier`` = 0) untouched for ``days``.

        Only closed rows are swept. A row with escalation memory is exactly
        the thing we promised to remember — deleting it because it has been
        quiet would hand a re-offender a fresh budget, which is the failure
        mode this table exists to prevent.

        ``channel`` scopes the sweep, the same way
        ``ChannelTriggerAuditRepository`` does and for the same reason: the
        retention window is declared as a per-trigger class attribute, so a
        global sweep silently means "whichever trigger ticks first wins".
        A channel that widened its window to 90 days for an incident review
        would still lose its rows on day 30 to some other channel's tick —
        no error, no warning, discovered only when someone goes looking.

        No row cap here, unlike ``find_open``: that one runs on every
        process start and its result is held in memory, while this keeps
        nothing. A cap would also make "deleted" a partial answer with no
        way to say so.

        Two callers, and the second one matters for that argument: besides
        the trigger's background cleanup tick, ``ManagedChannelIngress``
        calls this from the ingress path (throttled to once per
        process-day) because managed-only deployments have no background
        loop. So this can run inside a user turn. What keeps that bounded
        is not a cap but ``IngressGuard._persist`` being write-through ON
        TRANSITION ONLY — the table holds sessions that have stormed, not
        messages.

        The age comparison happens in PYTHON, not in the WHERE clause. The
        two dialects do not agree on how ``updated_at`` is spelled: sqlite
        round-trips it as ``2026-08-24T10:29:33.197094+00:00`` (isoformat
        default, 'T' separator) while a space-form cutoff string sorts
        differently at that one character.

        Precisely: string comparison is left-to-right, so the 'T'-vs-space
        difference at index 10 only decides the outcome when the date part
        is IDENTICAL. Cross-day comparisons are unaffected; rows on the
        cutoff's own calendar day compare as newer than they are and
        survive a sweep they should not. Narrow — but it is exactly the
        case a same-day retention test hits, which is how the first
        version of this method reported deleting 0 rows.

        ``event_time_str`` is the DB layer's existing answer to this
        asymmetry, and normalising both sides removes the edge entirely.

            Number of rows deleted (best-effort; 0 on driver error).
