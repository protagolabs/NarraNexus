@description: Data-access layer for the instance_artifacts table (pointer model).

Pointer model (2026-05-14): one row = one artifact = a pointer to an entry file
the agent wrote in its workspace. There is no version table anymore; "updating"
an artifact overwrites the pointer in place.

Provides:
- create(): insert one artifact row
- update_pointer(): overwrite file_path/size_bytes/title/description in place
- update_title(): rename an artifact (200-char cap)
- set_pinned(): toggle pinned flag; pinning clears session_id
- list_by_session(): non-pinned artifacts for a given session
- list_pinned(): pinned artifacts for an agent
- list_by_user(): all artifacts for a user, newest first
- delete() / bulk_delete(): remove artifact rows
