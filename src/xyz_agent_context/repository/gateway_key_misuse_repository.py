@description: Data-access writer for gateway_key_misuse — the record of abnormal
/ unauthorized use of a gateway key, for security monitoring.

One row per event. The row records a ``user_id`` that the CALLER already
reverse-resolved for the offending key (the gateway is the authority on which
identity the key is bound to) — this layer treats it as an opaque, already
authoritative value and stores it verbatim. It parses nothing, and knows
nothing about *how* the id was resolved.

Unlike the advisory ``ban_audit`` trail, this row IS the payload, not a side
note: the security monitor reads gateway_key_misuse read-only to drive its
response ladder, so a dropped row is a missed enforcement, not a lost
breadcrumb. ``record`` therefore does NOT swallow write failures — it lets them
surface so the caller (and the endpoint's 5xx) reflect that the authoritative
record was not persisted.

        ``deduped`` is False on a fresh insert and True when an at-least-once
        retry collapsed onto an existing row — so the caller can tell an
        idempotent retry apart from a first write (and observe the retry rate)
        instead of a status flag that is always True.

        ``user_id`` is the caller's already-reverse-resolved attribution, or
        None for an unresolved event (stored as an alert-only row; the response
        ladder never fires on a NULL id). None-valued fields fall through to the
        column defaults at the DB facade, so an alert-only row still gets its
        ``disposition_status='pending'`` and timestamps.

        ``hit_at`` is the authoritative time the misuse occurred, already
        normalised by the endpoint to the DATETIME(6) contract
        ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ffffff`` (UTC). When given it is the idempotency
        anchor: the table has a UNIQUE (key_hash, hit_at) index, so a
        write-succeeded-but-response-timed-out retry of the same event collapses
        to the SAME row instead of a duplicate (a hard signal is acted on once; a
        duplicate row would be double-acted). On that collision we return the
        existing row's id with ``deduped=True`` — an idempotent success, NOT a
        swallowed failure. Any OTHER write error still surfaces (a dropped row is
        a missed enforcement). When ``hit_at`` is omitted the column default
        (insert time) applies and no dedup is possible. The reverse-lookup keys
        on the SAME normalised ``hit_at`` that was written, so it always finds the
        row it just collided with.
