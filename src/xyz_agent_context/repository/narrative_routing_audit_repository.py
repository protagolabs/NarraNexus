@description: Persist the narrative-routing decision trail (E1).

Why this exists
===============
Narrative selection had no denominator. `selection_method`, the gate's score
evidence, and both LLM tiers' reasoning went to a ProgressMessage and loguru
and nowhere else — and docker logs rotate (incident lesson #5). So no question
of the form "how often does the continuity tier lock a thread it shouldn't?"
could be answered at all, and no routing change could be shown to have helped.

The non-obvious requirement
===========================
Storing IDs and scores is NOT enough to replay a decision. ``bm25_rank``
computes IDF and avgdl over the candidate set it is handed, so a candidate's
score depends on every other document in the pool; and the scored text
(``name`` + ``current_summary`` + ``description`` + ``topic_keywords``) is
rewritten wholesale by the async LLM updater on almost every turn with no
history retained. Re-reading `narratives` later therefore reconstructs a pool
that never existed, and replaying against it yields confident, wrong numbers.

So the audit stores the whole pool, each entry pointing at a content-addressed
snapshot of the exact text that was scored. Dedup makes this cheap: between
consecutive turns usually only the main narrative's summary moves, so a
100-candidate pool costs ~1 new snapshot row per turn.
``tests/narrative/test_routing_audit.py`` pins the replay property.

**Best-effort writes** — ``record`` NEVER raises into the caller. The observer
must not break the observed; losing an audit row beats failing a user's turn.
