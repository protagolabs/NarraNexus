@description: The owner of `steer_inbox` — the store for live-steering
injections destined for a running turn.

A producer appends one injection keyed by an OPAQUE ``run_id`` (the
RunRegistry's handle for a live run — this layer never interprets it);
the transport drains a run's unconsumed rows into its ``SteeringInlet``
at the next step boundary and marks them consumed.

Why a store at all when team messages already live in ``bus_messages``:
the table decouples the running loop from heterogeneous producers (team
is a bus message, an owner-chat interjection is not), and ``consumed_at``
is a per-RUN cursor the bus's per-(agent,channel) cursor cannot serve —
see ``schema/steer_schema.py`` for the full argument.

**Delivery semantics (single drainer).** ``consumed_at`` gives at-most-once
delivery UNDER ONE DRAINER PER RUN, which is the design (one live loop, one
transport). ``pull_unconsumed`` then ``mark_consumed`` are two statements
with no claim between them, so two drainers of the same ``run_id`` would
each inject the batch once (the family's ``ArtifactEventRepository`` makes
the same at-least-once trade). If a future path can run two drainers on one
run (e.g. an executor reaped mid-turn and its replacement resuming the same
run), switch to claim-then-read (a conditional UPDATE whose affected rows
are the claim — see ``job_repository.try_acquire_job``); do not rely on
``consumed_at`` alone there.

This is the family's plain-class shape (not a ``BaseRepository`` subclass:
auto-increment id, scoped range queries — same reasoning as
``ArtifactEventRepository``); reads still return ``SteerInjection`` so
callers get provenance typed.
