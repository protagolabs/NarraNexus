@description: Carrying a team's bulletin through a bundle.

A bundle is how a team is handed to someone else, and the bulletin is that
team's operating conventions. A bundle that left it behind would ship a team
which has forgotten how it works — and the recipient could not tell, because a
missing bulletin looks exactly like a team that never had one.

Its own module rather than more lines inside `builder.py` / `importer.py`: both
sides of the transfer have rules that only make sense next to each other (what
is dropped on the way out is what must not be trusted on the way in), and those
two files are already long enough that the pairing would be invisible.

**Two things are deliberately dropped.**

`author_id` — every agent id and the owner's user id are re-minted on import, so
a carried id would attribute a rule to whoever happens to hold that id in the
recipient's install, or to nobody. The SOURCE survives, so an agent-written rule
still reads as one and stays reviewable; only the dangling pointer goes.

The auto-summary — it describes progress inside the exporter's install. In the
recipient's it would be a confident account of work that never happened there,
sitting in every team turn's prompt until the worker replaces it. It costs
nothing to drop: the recipient's own worker regenerates one within minutes.

**A bundle is untrusted input.** It may have been hand-edited, so the import
side re-applies the same ceilings the live surfaces enforce, and refuses to
write a summary no matter what a payload claims. Malformed entries are skipped
rather than fatal — one bad row must not abort an otherwise good import and
leave the recipient with a half-written team.
