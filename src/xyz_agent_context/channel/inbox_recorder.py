@description: Records a conversation turn into the inbox — the platform's own
record of conversations the user was not in.

Replaces ``ChannelInboxWriter``, which wrote a five-row bundle into the
MessageBus tables (pseudo-agent, channel, membership, inbound, reply). Two
things that cost, both measured on prod 2026-08-17:

* 86% of ``bus_messages`` (28,605 of 33,164 rows) was IM inbox content. The
  bus's own table was mostly another feature's storage.
* The membership row it created had a ``last_read_at`` nothing ever advanced —
  159 of 172 IM memberships (92%) sat at NULL. The bus unread predicate is
  ``created_at > COALESCE(last_read_at, epoch)``, so 1,364 IM messages were
  permanently "unread" and rode into 90 agents' turn context, attributed to
  pseudo-agents like ``lark_user_<id>`` that no Source-Recognition rule
  describes.

The rows now live in ``inbox_threads`` / ``inbox_thread_messages``, which the
agent's unread injection does not read at all — so for everything written from
2026-08-17 on, the containment IS structural: there is no row in
``bus_messages`` to leak.

For rows written BEFORE that, it is a filter, and saying otherwise was the
comment's mistake. Every deployed database still holds the IM history the old
writer put in ``bus_messages``, and `_unread_predicate` would still hand it to the
model — so `LocalMessageBus._unread_predicate` excludes the dedicated-trigger channel
prefixes. That is honestly a prefix filter, of the same kind that drifted in
2026-07-03; what makes it survivable is that it is derived from the registry
rather than hand-maintained, and that it is temporary: it retires when the legacy
rows are purged. `reference/self_notebook/todo/2026-08-17-inbox-backfill-runbook.md`
owns that step.

WHAT THIS IS NOT: the notification store. ``InboxRepository`` / ``inbox_table``
is a different feature that shares the word — system alerts the platform pushes
at an owner. Nothing here touches it.

    Without it the column was set once at creation and never updated, so a second

    `chat_id` is the USER's id, identical across bots, so one person DMing two of
    an owner's agents collided. The writer this replaced created a
    `bus_channel_members` row per agent, so both sides were visible — this was a

        text it sent the peer (a peer is reached only by the bus send tool), so
