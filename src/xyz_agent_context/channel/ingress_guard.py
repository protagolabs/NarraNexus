@description: Channel-agnostic ingress circuit breaker — "is this message
worth processing at all?"

Written for the 2026-08-17 ingress design after the 8/14 DM ping-pong
incident (70+ hours, 66k messages, monitoring entirely green). The
inbound path had message-IDENTITY dedup and burst merging, but nothing
that looked at what was actually arriving: every message ran the full
pipeline (narrative retrieval, persona update, agent loop, reply
decision). When the far side is a broken agent reciting the same line,
every layer is individually correct and the whole is a perpetual motion
machine.

This guard is the L2/L3 half of that design — a HARD breaker. The L0
observation tier and L1 merge tier land with the unified ingress in the
IM/Bus refactor. Their absence is covered by making the entry condition
conservative rather than by shipping a lenient breaker: a session must be
BOTH fast AND repetitive. Normal high-frequency conversation — a user
firing off six thoughts, a busy group at peak, a job batch — varies its
content and is structurally immune, which is what the L0 observation
window was there to protect.

Relationship to the two breakers that already exist:
  - ``channel_trigger_base``'s fast-death breaker → "my credential is
    broken, stop restarting the subscriber"
  - ``agent_framework/loop/circuit_breaker`` → "my turns keep failing,
    stop scheduling them"
  - **this one** → "the traffic arriving is not worth processing"
All three share the escalate-cooldown-then-half-open paradigm; none
subsumes another.

Binding rules #14/#15: this gates INGRESS. It never caps, cancels, or
time-limits a running ``agent_loop``, and it never judges the agent's own
model, verbosity, or output — only the shape of inbound traffic.

Clock: one clock, wall-clock, injectable. The credential breaker can use
``time.monotonic()`` because it is memory-only; a cooldown that must
survive a restart has to be expressed in wall time, and running two
clocks in one state machine is how off-by-one-restart bugs are born.
Callers omit ``now``; tests pass it explicitly so every temporal
assertion is arithmetic rather than sleeping.

        1. ``health_snapshot`` and the heartbeat read the IN-MEMORY counts.
           After a restart ``_sessions`` is empty, so a process holding 50
           isolated conversations — 10 of them mid-24h-cooldown — reported
           ``ingress_breaker_open_count: 0``. Deploy, and the dashboard
           goes green while the conversations stay deaf. That is precisely
           the L2-health blind spot (incident lesson #4) this design cites.
        2. A reloaded cooldown only revived when that key next spoke. The
           row was right; nothing read it until the damage was already
           being re-done.

        Loads only the sessions still INSIDE a cooldown.

        The first version loaded every ``tier > 0`` row and justified it
        with "closed ones are swept by retention" — which has the relation
        backwards: retention sweeps ``tier = 0`` EXCLUSIVELY, and this
        loads ``tier > 0`` exclusively, so the two never intersect. A
        session that trips once and goes quiet keeps its row forever (tier
        decay needs further ``admit()`` calls it will never get), so
        "every open row" is a lifetime trip log, not a current state.
        Loading it would make both the footprint and
        ``open_session_count()`` climb with every deploy — turning I4's
        "reports 0 after a restart" into "reports a growing historical
        total", which is just as useless for "how many are isolated now".

        The escalation memory does NOT need preloading: ``_load()`` fetches
        it lazily at the only moment it matters — when that key speaks

        cooldown, or escalation memory — is exactly what we promised to
        remember, so it stays.

        Dropping a closed session is lossless by construction: its durable
        row (if it ever had one) stays in the DB and is re-read lazily the
        next time that key speaks.

        Also ages silent tiers down first (in memory only), so a session

        ``cooldown_until`` is only ever cleared by a probe, so a criterion
        of "never had one" would pin every session that has ever tripped.

        One visible consequence of dropping: the next message from that key
        reloads the row, and ``_load`` keeps only a cooldown still in the

        the ordinary counting path instead of arriving as a half-open
        probe. Same shape as the post-restart behaviour ``_half_open``

        One definition, two callers — the durable load path and the

        ``row.*`` and ``state.*`` respectively, and the copies drifted:
        the same sentence about "the later of the two" landed on two
        different facts because the two sources hold different values for
        ``cooldown_until``. Keeping the rule in one place is what makes

        Silence starts when the isolation ENDS. ``tier_changed_at`` is
        stamped at trip time and the cooldown runs from there, so counting
        from it bills the sentence itself as good behaviour — the same
        double-credit that ruled out ``last_tripped_at``. At tier 3 the
        cooldown alone is six steps.

        This is ALSO the whole of "never decay while still isolated": an
        unexpired cooldown puts the anchor in the future, so the result can
        only be zero. A separate "am I cooling right now?" check would read
        as a second, independent criterion and invite the two to drift.

        schedule, not restart at five minutes; otherwise a persistent
        loop oscillates at the cheapest tier forever.

        **The probe is judged, not just counted.** The first version

        re-earning a whole ``rate_bar`` — so every cooldown actually let
        20 (agent) or 60 (human) full pipeline runs through, each
        producing another outbound message. "Exactly one probe" was true
        of the admission and false of the consequence. If the probe
        carries a fingerprint this session was reciting when it tripped,
        that IS the loop resuming and it re-trips immediately.

        A genuinely new message does not re-trip: it clears the memory and
        resumes ordinary counting, so a person whose first sentence after
        a 24h cooldown is real conversation is not punished for it.

        After a restart ``trip_fingerprints`` is empty (memory-only), so
        the first probe of a reloaded session falls back to the
