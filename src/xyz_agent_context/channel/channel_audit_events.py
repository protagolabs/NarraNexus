@description: Generic IM channel trigger audit event-type constants.

Module-level string constants (NOT an enum) so:
1. Callers can grep for them as plain strings.
2. The DB column stays a simple VARCHAR — adding a new event type does
   not require a schema migration.

Naming versus Lark's pre-existing `lark_trigger_audit_repository.py`:
- ``transport_*`` replaces ``ws_*`` because Telegram uses long polling and
  Slack offers Socket Mode + Event API — none of those are exclusively
  WebSocket. Lark's existing audit table keeps the ``ws_*`` strings until
  Phase 2 migrates it to write into ``channel_trigger_audit``.
- ``debounce_merged`` is new in Phase 1. There is no Lark equivalent
  because the existing trigger does not implement debounce.

# The managed surface's lifecycle in the same table as native ingress:
# a managed message that produced nothing must be as answerable as a
# native one (lesson #5 — "the N expected events are all missing" is
# itself evidence). `managed_ingress_processed` (the run-completed row)
# predates these and is written by ChannelTriggerBase.managed_after_run.

EVENT_MANAGED_ATTACHMENTS = "managed_attachments_converted"
# Manyfold's files/write ingest leg (backend/routes/manyfold/files.py):
# channel column carries "manyfold". Every write attempt gets a row —
# the 2026-08-05 staging diagnosis had to infer write outcomes from the
# PLATFORM's side because our own gateway kept no account.

EVENT_INGRESS_DROPPED_UNPARSED = "ingress_dropped_unparsed"
# parse_event succeeded but yielded NEITHER text NOR attachment refs, so
# the pipeline has nothing to run the agent on. Same audit-blind-spot

# shape the extractor didn't recognise (live incident 2026-08-06: a post
# body without the language wrapper) vanished without a trace.
EVENT_INGRESS_DROPPED_EMPTY = "ingress_dropped_empty"
# A group-room message that did not @-mention this bot. Once a bot holds a
# read-all-group-messages scope EVERY group message reaches the subscriber,
# and replying to all of them is the single most visible misbehaviour a
# channel bot can have. Dropped at ingress rather than left to the model to
# judge — but audited, because "the bot ignored me in the group" must stay
# answerable from the trace (lessons #3/#5).

# Fast-death circuit breaker (2026-08-04): a subscriber that keeps dying
# within seconds of starting (cleared secret → silent return, no exception

# that one is about our own DB row; this one is about the platform
# refusing / dropping our outbound message. Details typically carry
