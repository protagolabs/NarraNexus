@description: Generic IM channel trigger audit event-type constants.

Module-level string constants (NOT an enum) so:
1. Callers can grep for them as plain strings.
2. The DB column stays a simple VARCHAR — adding a new event type does
   not require a schema migration.

Naming versus Lark's pre-existing `lark_trigger_audit_repository.py`:
- ``transport_*`` replaces ``ws_*`` because Telegram uses long polling and
  Slack offers Socket Mode + Event API — none of those are exclusively
  WebSocket. Lark's existing audit table keeps the ``ws_*`` strings until
  Phase 2 migrates it to write into ``channel_trigger_audit``.
- ``debounce_merged`` is new in Phase 1. There is no Lark equivalent
  because the existing trigger does not implement debounce.
