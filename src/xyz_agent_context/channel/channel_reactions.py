@description: Shared "agent reacts to the user's message" vocabulary + helpers.

The unified ``react_to_user_message`` MCP tool exists on every IM channel module,
and every IM channel's ``get_instructions`` renders the same "ack early" directive.
The ONLY genuinely per-channel part is the semantic→platform-token map; the tool
body (resolve → react → best-effort envelope) and the instruction template are
identical, so they live here — in the ``channel/`` package, a legal shared
dependency of every module (same seam as ``channel_trigger_base``), so this does
not violate rule #3 (modules never import each other).

Add a new "task mood": one entry in ``REACTION_VOCABULARY`` + one line in each
module's own semantic→token map. The prompt menu and the tool body update
automatically.
