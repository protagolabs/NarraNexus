@description: Per-request routing between a user's own LLM config and the
system-default NetMind config, with quota gating on the system branch.

Wired into backend.auth.auth_middleware. Decision tree (aligned with
business-layer `api_config.get_user_llm_configs` so the two entry points
cannot disagree):

  0. SystemProviderService.is_enabled() == False
     -> request path (default): strict no-op; local mode / disabled env leaves
        every ContextVar untouched, agent code paths keep the existing
        llm_config.json global fallback.
     -> background path (resolve_and_set(..., own_config_when_system_disabled=
        True)): fall through to the user's OWN provider config, because the
        detached-helper injection clears the ContextVars first. See
        resolve_and_set / resolve_and_set_provider_for_user.

  1. quota row exists (a free tier was granted). "Free tier first" is
     PLATFORM BEHAVIOR, not a user preference (2026-07-18 — the old
     prefer_system toggle was removed; everyone draws the free tier
     first while it lasts):
     1a. quota has budget  -> route "system" (cost_tracker deducts post-call)
     1b. no budget + has complete own config -> route "user" on their own
         key. The one-time "switched to your own key" notice is deduped via
         the prefer_system_override column, repurposed as a NOTICE LATCH:
         armed (1) while on the free tier, CAS 1→0 on the first exhausted
         run (that caller emits the notice, #48), re-armed on the next run
         with budget. NOTE: the free tier is a one-time registration grant
         with no periodic refresh — budget only comes back via a manual
         staff grant, at which point the user auto-returns to the free tier.
     1c. no budget + no own provider         -> QuotaExceededError
         (user must add a provider before the app becomes usable again)

  2. no quota row at all (no free tier granted):
     2a. has complete own config -> route "user" (quota NOT consulted)
     2b. own config missing / incomplete -> NoProviderConfiguredError

All three exceptions carry a stable `error_code` class attribute that
auth_middleware returns verbatim to the client; the frontend
pattern-matches on this string to decide which remediation UI to show.
