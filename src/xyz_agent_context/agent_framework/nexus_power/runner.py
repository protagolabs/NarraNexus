@description: The standalone-process host — the agent turn runs as its
own process (Owner decision).

One protocol, two transports: in the cloud the per-user executor
container hosts this loop behind its existing HTTP NDJSON endpoint; in
local/desktop mode the driver spawns ``python -m …nexus_power.runner``
and speaks the SAME serialization over pipes (iron rule #7: both modes
behave identically).

Wire shape: stdin carries ONE JSON line —
``{"thread_id", "messages", "options"}`` — stdout streams NDJSON lines:
``{"event": {…}}`` (shape per ``options.output_mode``) and a final
``{"exit": {...}}``. Lines have NO length ceiling: readers must buffer
manually (the 128 KiB aiohttp line-limit incident of 2026-07-08 —
image-bearing events reach hundreds of KB).

Process-isolation payoffs: a loop crash never takes the host down;
cancellation = SIGTERM (trapped into a cooperative signal so pairing
invariants hold) plus process-group reaping; resources account per
process. Every event also lands in the local NDJSON truth file under
``<cwd>/.nexus_power/`` (constraint C1: the log is recorded, always).
