@description: NexusPowerPrompts — the single namespace for every prompt the
framework speaks (Owner decision 2026-07-29: one non-instantiable class;
call classmethods, get strings).

Design points:
  1. Non-instantiable: statelessness is enforced, not promised.
  2. The class LOADS AND FILLS only; long-form copy lives in
     ``resources/*.md`` — wording changes never touch code review.
  3. Pure functions: no clocks, no environment, no randomness; the
     byte-stability CI test aims straight at this class.
  4. Overridable: a subclass replacing individual classmethods is a
     complete prompt pack; the assembler takes the class reference.

Section roster (v1): the constitution (the monologue/expression
contract — the framework's identity), workspace tool guidance, and the
expandable-capability frame + cards. The platform's own system prompt
(identity, scenario, modules) arrives inside the materialized messages
and is deliberately NOT restated here.
