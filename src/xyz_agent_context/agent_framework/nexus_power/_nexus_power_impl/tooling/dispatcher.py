@description: ToolDispatcher — the single dispatcher over every
capability channel (ToolExecutor implementation).

Invariants:
  - ``visible_tools()`` = union of channel tools − disallowed
    (∩ allowlist when set), in (channel order, registration order) with
    a generation cache — expansion appends, never resorts (constraint
    C2; channels own deterministic registration);
  - every ``execute`` passes the PolicyEngine first (fail-closed); a
    deny is an error-shaped result, never an exception;
  - label tools (``marker_only`` annotation or the injected marker
    list) short-circuit after adjudication: the call IS the signal; its
    meaning lives in the event stream;
  - "what the model sees ≡ what is registered" holds by construction —
    prompts and schemas derive from the same specs.
