@description: The ``wait_for_input`` control tool — the agent proactively
HOLDS the turn open for new input instead of ending it.

Motivating case: a team-room agent that has done its part and expects a
teammate (or the user) to reply shortly. Without this it must end the turn
and be re-triggered from scratch when the reply lands; with it, it says
"I'll wait", the loop blocks on the steering inlet up to N seconds, and the
moment a message arrives it rides the next model step (fusion is immediate).

Two outcomes only (the Owner's contract): an input-arrival (the loop
injects it and continues) or a timeout (nothing within N seconds → the loop tells
the agent so it can wrap up or wait again).

This channel NEVER blocks: its ``call`` only records the request on the
shared ``WaitState``; the loop reads it at the step boundary and does the
blocking wait itself (the loop owns the inlet and the cancellation signal).
This mirrors ``SchedulingChannel``'s plan handoff — a channel signals the
loop through shared state rather than reaching into it.
