    """Copy the host Claude OAuth credential into the isolated CONFIG_DIR.

    OAuth used to point ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` straight at ``~/.claude`` so the
    CLI could read ``~/.claude/.credentials.json``. That re-opened the very
    leak #72 closed for keyed auth: the personal ``~/.claude/settings.json``
    ``env`` block (ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL/AUTH_TOKEN) overrode our provider and
    503'd, and the agent_loop raced the user's own Claude Code on
    ``~/.claude/.claude.json`` (2026-07-09 incident). OAuth now gets its own
    isolated dir; we stage ONLY the credential file into it — never
    ``settings.json`` — mirroring Codex's ``_stage_codex_oauth_credentials``.

    ``config_dir`` is ``settings.claude_oauth_config_path`` (a ``str`` or
    ``Path``); it is the same dir ``ClaudeConfig.to_cli_env`` puts in
    ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` for the OAuth branch.

    newest-wins: copy the host credential in only when it is newer than the
    already-staged copy (or the staged copy is missing). This propagates a
    fresh ``claude auth login`` while NOT clobbering a token the CLI refreshed
    in-place inside the isolated dir — clobbering it would break rotating
    refresh tokens (the host copy still carries the already-consumed one).

    KNOWN COST (host may be logged out): this stages one-way host → isolated
    dir. If the isolated CLI refreshes the OAuth token in place, the host
    ``~/.claude/.credentials.json`` keeps the now-rotated refresh token and the
    user's own interactive ``claude`` gets logged out once its access token
    expires. Accepted tradeoff, matching Codex's one-way ``_stage_codex_oauth_
    credentials``; there is no write-back. See the mirror md for the rationale.

    """Map the framework-neutral slot params to ClaudeAgentOptions kwargs.

    ⚠️ This maps to what claude-agent-sdk 0.1.43 + the Claude Code CLI
    actually accept — NOT 1:1 to the Anthropic API thinking shape.

    How the SDK/CLI handle thinking (verified 2026-06-11 against
    ``claude_agent_sdk/_internal/transport/subprocess_cli.py`` + CLI 2.1.x):
      * The SDK converts ``ClaudeAgentOptions.thinking`` into a
        ``--max-thinking-tokens N`` CLI flag (adaptive→32000, enabled→budget,
        disabled→0). It NEVER passes ``--thinking adaptive``.
      * The Claude Code CLI turns a POSITIVE ``--max-thinking-tokens`` into the
        LEGACY ``thinking:{type:"enabled",budget_tokens:N}`` API shape — which
        every current model (Opus 4.6/4.7/4.8, Sonnet 4.6, Fable 5) rejects
        with ``400 "thinking.type.enabled" is not supported for this model``.
      * The ONLY adaptive lever the CLI exposes is ``--effort <level>``. With
        ``--effort`` set and NO ``--max-thinking-tokens``, the CLI uses
        adaptive thinking at that effort. With no flags at all it falls back
        to the rejected ``enabled`` default.

    Therefore (incident 2026-06-11):
      on / auto / unknown -> {"effort": <level>}  — NO "thinking" key, so the
                             SDK omits --max-thinking-tokens and the CLI goes
                             adaptive. Auto/unknown effort defaults to "high"
                             (the Anthropic server default) so --effort is
                             ALWAYS present — with no flags the CLI sends the
                             rejected enabled shape.
      off                 -> {"thinking": {"type": "disabled"}}  — the one
                             --max-thinking-tokens value (0) that maps to a
                             non-enabled request. Effort is moot with thinking
                             off.

    We never emit a positive --max-thinking-tokens, so we never produce the
    rejected ``enabled`` shape. SlotConfig validates the vocabulary; unknown
    values degrade safely (adaptive / "high") with a warning, never raise —
    a broken tuning knob must not take the agent loop down.

    Caveat: a slot deliberately pinned to a pre-4.6 model that only accepts
    ``enabled`` + budget_tokens (e.g. Sonnet 4.5) would not get a thinking
    budget here. The platform targets current models, where effort-driven
    adaptive is the path; revisit only if we add legacy-model support.
