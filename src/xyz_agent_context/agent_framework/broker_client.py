@description: Orchestrator-side client for the per-user Executor Broker.

In cloud, the agent-loop runs in a per-user Executor container that the
broker spawns (only that user's workspace mounted, no platform secrets).
The executor URL is therefore DYNAMIC per user — this resolves it by
asking the broker to ensure the user's executor is up, returning its URL.

Gated on ``BROKER_URL`` (only the cloud orchestrator sets it). When unset
— local/desktop, or the older single static ``AGENT_EXECUTOR_URL`` model
— this returns ``None`` and the caller falls back (in-process driver, or
the static executor URL). So the integration is additive and backward
compatible.

This is the cold-start trigger point: ``ensure`` may spin up a container
(seconds), which is why the timeout is generous and why the run-start
flow surfaces a "waking up" state to the user (see handoff doc).
