@description: Shared helpers for classifying and redacting LLM provider
failures.

Both live here (rather than inside any single trigger) because the same
two questions — "is this a credential/auth failure?" and "how do I show
this error to the owner without leaking their key?" — are asked by every
background LLM path: the message bus, the narrative updater, the Step-5
entity/memory hooks. Before this module the logic existed only inside
``message_bus_trigger`` and the other paths silently swallowed 401s
(2026-07 incident: an expired platform OpenAI key degraded long memory for
~2 weeks with zero owner-facing signal). Consolidating here is the single
source of truth those paths now share.

The classifier reads the RAW error string (keyword markers only, never
displayed). The redactor is what gets shown to the owner. Keep the two
separate — classification must see the unmasked text.
