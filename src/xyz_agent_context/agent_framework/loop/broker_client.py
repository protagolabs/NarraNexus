@description: Orchestrator-side client for the per-user Executor Broker.

In cloud, the agent-loop runs in a per-user Executor container that the
broker spawns (only that user's workspace mounted, no platform secrets).
The executor URL is therefore DYNAMIC per user — this resolves it by
asking the broker to ensure the user's executor is up, returning its URL.

Gated on ``BROKER_URL`` (only the cloud orchestrator sets it). When unset
— local/desktop, or the older single static ``AGENT_EXECUTOR_URL`` model
— this returns ``None`` and the caller falls back (in-process driver, or
the static executor URL). So the integration is additive and backward
compatible.

This is the cold-start trigger point: ``ensure`` may spin up a container
(seconds), which is why the timeout is generous and why the run-start
flow surfaces a "waking up" state to the user (see handoff doc).

    ``allow_stale_replace`` is the CALLER's verdict on whether the broker may
    destroy this user's container to roll a stale executor image — i.e.
    whether anyone is using it right now. This module cannot compute that and
    deliberately does not: it is a transport client, the fact lives in the
    orchestrator's DB, and the decision belongs to whoever holds run context
    (step 3 passes ``executor_reaper.no_live_recorded_run_for``'s answer;
    callers that are not a run leave it False).

    False is the safe default in both directions — it can only ever DELAY an
    image roll, never kill a run — so an omission degrades rather than
    breaks. Named for the one replacement reason it gates: the broker has
    others (an unreachable container, capacity churn) and those must stay
    unconditional, because a container nobody can reach has no run on it to
    protect.

    Returns ``None`` when no broker is configured (caller falls back).
    Raises on broker/transport error — in cloud we must NOT silently fall
    back to an in-process spawn (that would defeat isolation); the run
    fails loudly instead. A transport failure (broker unreachable) is raised
    as ``ExecutorUnreachableError`` so step_3 surfaces an actionable
    ``infra_transient`` error at cold start instead of a bare httpx exception
    escaping the pipeline (issue ②). HTTP status errors from the broker are
    NOT converted — those flow as-is.
