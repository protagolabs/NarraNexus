@description: AgentLoopDriver that delegates the loop to the Executor service.

Conforms to the ``AgentLoopDriver`` Protocol (same ``agent_loop``
async-generator contract as the local claude/codex drivers), but instead
of spawning the CLI in-process it POSTs to the Executor service and
streams the raw event dicts back. This is the network transport behind
the existing step-3 seam — the mirror of ``HttpAgentRuntimeClient`` one
layer down.

Selected by ``get_agent_loop_driver`` when ``AGENT_EXECUTOR_URL`` is set
(cloud orchestrator). Unset → the local driver runs in-process, so
``bash run.sh`` and the desktop build are unchanged (binding rule #7).

The scoped provider configs travel in the request body (see
``executor_protocol.build_agent_loop_request``) because they normally
ride a ContextVar that does not survive the network hop.

This driver owns NO wire-format knowledge beyond calling
``build_agent_loop_request`` and POSTing what it returns — which is why the
resume-capability HMAC (2026-07-28) needed no change here: the token and its
``issued_at`` are minted inside that builder and ride the same body dict. Keep
it that way; do not hand-assemble the body in this module.

Stream reader (2026-07-09 fix): uses ``resp.content.iter_any()`` +
manual line-splitting rather than aiohttp's line iterator. The line
iterator has an unmovable 128 KiB per-line ceiling (aiohttp's
``StreamReader.readuntil`` raises ``LineTooLong`` once the buffer
crosses ``_high_water = limit * 2 = 131072`` without seeing a newline),
which is BELOW the size of a single NDJSON event carrying a base64
image (tool_result events run 150-400 KiB). The multimodal-large-file
incident (2026-07-08) traces to exactly that: any Read on an image
>~90 KiB crashed the transport, killing the executor connection, and
the fallback helper LLM covered it up with a fake reply. The fix lifts
the ceiling to ``_MAX_STREAM_BYTES`` (aligned with the SDK's own
``max_buffer_size`` in ``adapters.claude.sdk``).
