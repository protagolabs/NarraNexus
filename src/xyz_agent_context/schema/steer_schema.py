@description: Live-steering injection — one message routed INTO a turn
that is already running, instead of triggering a fresh turn.

One uniform inbox for the "append to the running loop" capability. Its
job is DECOUPLING, not durability: the running loop drains ONE store
instead of reaching into each producer's native home. That matters
because the producers are heterogeneous — a team room post already lives
in ``bus_messages``, but an owner-chat interjection is not a bus message
at all, so "just query bus_messages" would miss half the producers, and
every new source would add another special case in the feeder. Same
outbox/inbox pattern the codebase already uses for
``instance_artifact_events``. (IM producers are out of scope for v1.) A
producer writes one of these keyed by the target run; the transport drains
the run's unconsumed rows into its ``SteeringInlet`` at the next step
boundary.

NOTE (2026-08-24): the owner-chat producer's FIRST landing (the chat
WebSocket, PR #355) does NOT go through this inbox — it pushes the
interjection straight into the in-flight run's in-process ``SteerChannel``
(ephemeral, bounded on the WS write edge by the same MAX_CONTENT_BYTES /
MAX_UNCONSUMED_PER_RUN this repo defines). So for that path the
interjection's EFFECT persists (it rides the turn and shapes the assistant
reply, which chat memory does save), but the literal owner message is not
itself written to chat memory yet — persisting it on consumption (for
refresh-history fidelity + next-turn recall) is a scoped follow-up, not the
current behaviour. Do not read this inbox as the owner-chat path of record
until that lands.

``consumed_at`` is the OTHER thing the bus cannot lend: a per-RUN consume
cursor. The bus's ``last_processed_at`` is per ``(agent, channel)`` and
is already the trigger's (it decides new dispatches); it cannot double as
a running turn's steer cursor — least of all when one agent has several
concurrent runs. Per row, per run, is the only shape that survives that.

``run_id`` is deliberately OPAQUE here: this schema does not know how the
orchestrator identifies a live run (that is the RunRegistry's concern),
only that whoever produces and whoever drains agree on the handle. That
keeps the storage layer decoupled from the routing design.

``source`` records which producer wrote it so the prompt layer can phrase
the injection appropriately (a teammate's room message reads differently
from the owner interjecting) — the mechanism is identical, the wording is
not. Injection is append-only by contract; nothing here mutates a prior
row's content.

    * ``created_at`` — the DB default stamps it (so it is never the producer's
