Hook Schema - Hook system data models

@file_name: hook_schema.py
@author: NetMind.AI
@date: 2025-11-27
@description: Defines data models used by the Hook system for more structured parameter passing

=============================================================================
Design Goals
=============================================================================

Structuring the **kwargs parameters of hook_after_event_execution into several data models:

1. HookExecutionContext - Execution context (required)
   - event_id, agent_id, user_id, working_source

2. HookIOData - Input/output data (required)
   - input_content, final_output

3. HookExecutionTrace - Execution trace (optional)
   - event_log, agent_loop_response

4. ctx_data: ContextData - Complete context (existing, optional)

Usage example:
    await hook_manager.hook_after_event_execution(
        execution_ctx=HookExecutionContext(...),
        io_data=HookIOData(...),
        trace=HookExecutionTrace(...),  # optional
        ctx_data=ctx_data,              # optional
    )

# reply VERB — a team room takes `message_team`, a peer DM takes
# `message_agent`). Consumer: MessageBusModule's desk hooks, which declare one
# verb and suppress the other on this marker. Lives here (not in message_bus)
# because both sides of the platform read it and schema is the shared base layer.
#
# It used to mean the OPPOSITE: while the room auto-posted plain text and its
# prompt forbade delivery tools, `context_runtime` emptied the turn's whole
# expressive surface on this key. That exception is gone — the room takes a tool
# call like every other surface — and the comment describing it outlived the

# tool at all. Patrol is the only such surface — the platform asks the lead to
# compose the room's status line and posts it under the room's own marker, so a
# `message_team` call would be the lead chatting mid-patrol, which is what the
# patrol prompt forbids in so many words.
#
# It exists because "forbid it in prose" is the thing this redesign is a
# reaction to. A patrol turn carries BUS_TEAM_ROOM_EXTRA_KEY, and on that key
# `message_team` is declared as the turn's default reply tool and named by both
# frameworks' reply reminders — contradicting the prompt three lines above it,
# and on NexusPower actively nudging the lead to do the forbidden thing. On
# this marker the module declares nothing and takes both send verbs off the
# desk, and the trigger withholds the mute-turn nudge.
