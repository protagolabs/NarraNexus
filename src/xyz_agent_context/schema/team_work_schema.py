@description: Team work board — the first task-level object in the product.

Everything before this recorded CONVERSATION (messages, runs, errands): a task
existed only inside the turn discussing it, so a Leader's assignment died with
its own run and nobody could notice it stalled. A work item is a task that
outlives the run that created it.

Layered with, not merged into, the errand object (owner decision 2026-08-07):
an errand is a MESSAGE-level fact recorded automatically (A @ B opens it, B's
reply closes it); a work item is a TASK-level object maintained explicitly
through tools, and routinely spans several errands.

    Two of these are NOT the model's to write:

    * ``STALLED`` is derived by the platform from ``bus_agent_activity`` plus
      errand timeouts. Iron rule #15 — a correctness-critical fact must not
      depend on model obedience. The lead's judgement applies to what to DO
      about a stalled item, never to whether it is stalled.
    * ``PAUSED`` is what a stop leaves behind. Stopping a run tree stops the
      RUNNING, not the task; without this state the item stays ``OPEN`` and the
      next patrol dutifully revives exactly what the owner just stopped.
      Resuming is an explicit user action.
