@description: Per-turn execution profile (fast mode). None everywhere = today's behavior.

The profile rides the existing pure-kwargs chain (run_stream ->
AgentRuntime.run -> RunContext -> TurnInput -> driver kwargs -> executor
wire) as one frozen value object. Every consumer must treat an absent
profile — and a profile left at defaults — as "behave exactly as today";
fast mode is strictly additive.
