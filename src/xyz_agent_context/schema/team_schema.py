# The synthetic markers a team room is built on. Defined with Team rather than
# inside any one consumer: six modules construct or match them (the bus trigger,
# the teams route, the runs route, the bulletin notice, the work-board tools,
# the summary worker), and each had been retyping the literal.
#
# A team channel's ``created_by`` is this prefix + team_id, which does two jobs:
# it identifies the room deterministically without an extra column, and it makes
# the owner a NON-AGENT — MessageBusTrigger always activates a channel's owner,
# so a member in that seat would answer everything. Delivery in a team room is
# purely @-mention driven, and that property rests on this marker.
