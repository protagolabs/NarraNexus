@description: Unified configuration management

Uses pydantic-settings to centrally manage all environment variables, replacing
scattered load_dotenv() + os.getenv() calls throughout the codebase.

Priority: .env file > system environment variables.
When users configure API keys through the desktop app or run.sh, those values
are written to .env and MUST take precedence over pre-existing shell env vars.

Usage:
    from xyz_agent_context.settings import settings

    api_key = settings.google_api_key
    db_host = settings.db_host

    # ===== Message-bus worker pool =====
    # How many bus turns may run concurrently in the trigger process. This is
    # OUR resource decision, not a policy on how long an agent may run (binding
    # rule #14) — the pool caps how many rooms we can serve at once, and a pool
    # too small shows up to the user as "the group chat is dead", which is the
    # one failure mode the platform is responsible for avoiding.
    #
    # Was hard-coded at 3, which made a slot shortage both invisible and
    # unfixable without a code change. 8 is the new floor-of-comfort: a bus turn
    # is almost entirely await (LLM + DB), so slots are cheap, and a single team
    # room relaying between members can occupy several at once.
    #
    # Slot wait is inside the `queue_wait_s` that `[bus-timing]` reports, so
    # raising this and re-reading `make latency-report` is a measurable change,
    # not a guess.
    #
    # CROSS-REPO DEPENDENCY — read before raising this again.
    # Production runs `run_worker_supervisor`: poller + jobs + bus + every
    # channel trigger share ONE asyncio loop and therefore ONE MySQL pool. That
    # pool is sized in the deploy repo, `stacks/narranexus-app/compose.yml`
    # (service `workers`, `MYSQL_POOL_SIZE`), whose comment derives the number
    # from "poller(3) + jobs(5) + bus + every channel worker/subscriber". This
    # value is the `bus` term in that arithmetic; changing it here without
    # revisiting that number there is how a bus change turns into "the database
    # got slow" for poller, jobs and every IM channel at once.
    #
    # Why raising it is nonetheless cheap: a connection is borrowed per QUERY,
    # not held for the turn. A bus turn spends ~20 of its ~24 seconds waiting on
    # an LLM and holds nothing during that time — which is also why the pool has
    # always been sized for the typical concurrent QUERY mix rather than the
    # theoretical task count (channel triggers alone allow 50 workers each).
    #
    # If this ever needs to go higher, get evidence first: a `worker_starvation`
    # row in `service_audit` means the pool really is the bottleneck (see
    # `_check_worker_starvation`); its absence means it is not.
    #
    # What changed on 2026-08-14, and why `worker_starvation` is now ambiguous:
    # a team-room reply is posted from INSIDE the turn, so the next hop of a
    # relay is dispatched while the previous agent's turn is STILL RUNNING (an
    # agent may legitimately keep working for a long time after replying —
    # binding rule #14). A slot is released at the end of the turn, not at the
    # reply. So one room's D-hop relay now holds up to D slots at once, where
    # it used to hold 1, and "slots are cheap because a bus turn is mostly
    # await" is only half true: the waiting is cheap, the HOLDING is not.
    # A `worker_starvation` row during a busy team relay is therefore an
    # expected shape, not evidence that someone's agent is wedged — read it
    # together with how many rooms were relaying at the time.

    # caches (Anthropic byte-prefix, DeepSeek/vLLM block-hash) can hit.
    # Relocation moves bytes, it never drops them — the model still sees
    # every relocated section each turn. Off = context assembly is
    # functionally equivalent to the pre-R4 layout — NOT byte-identical, which
    # earlier wording claimed: the OFF path still applies three unconditional
    # determinism normalisations (narrative timestamp canonicalisation,
    # module-block (priority, name) total order, mcp_servers sort). Those move
    # no content and drop none, but they do change bytes, so "off" restores the
    # old STRUCTURE, not the old byte stream. Independent from
    # the synthetic transcript: relocation benefits every framework and
    # every turn; resume is claude_code-only. This is a fail-open ops gate,

    # ===== Helper-LLM one-shot bounds =====

    # NOT the agent_loop, so bounding it does not violate 铁律 #14 — a helper
    # extraction that never returns is a defect, not a "user waiting" cost.
    #
    # These matter most for the CLI-backed helper (subscription/OAuth), which

    # which surfaced as "Job stuck at 正在创建" when helper_llm was set to Claude.
    # Kept self-consistent: the wall-clock total is the HARD cap on one
    # one-shot; the per-request timeout × (1 + retries) is the SOFT budget the
    # CLI's own retries spend inside it. 60_000ms × (1 + 1) = 120s = the total,
