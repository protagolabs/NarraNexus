@description: Canonical new-agent provisioning sequence, extracted as a
shared seam (pre-open review #3 on PR-2).

Before this file, "how a brand-new agent becomes usable" existed as THREE
separate, drifting copies:
  1. `backend/routes/auth.py`'s `create_agent` route — the ORIGINAL,
     complete sequence (semantic source of truth).
  2. `_social_mcp_tools.py`'s `create_agent` MCP tool closure — a half
     copy that skipped default-skill installation entirely, so an
     agent-created-agent had none of the marketplace's default skills.
  3. `backend/routes/agents/social_network.py`'s `create-agent` HTTP route
     — a fuller copy (added in the same PR-2 pre-open review) but still a
     hand-maintained duplicate of (1).

`provision_new_agent` is the single place this sequence now lives. All
THREE call sites delegate to it: auth.py's create_agent route, the
create_agent MCP tool closure, and the social-network create-agent HTTP
route. auth.py remains the SEMANTIC SOURCE (this seam mirrors what its route
established); it keeps only the parts that are NOT the shared sequence —
user-existence validation up front, team assignment (#43) after
provisioning, and building CreateAgentResponse from a re-fetched row.

Sequence (mirrors auth.py's create_agent route as of 2026-08-10):
  0. AgentRepository.add_agent — insert the `agents` row. NOT best-effort:
     a failed insert (duplicate id, DB down) means there is no agent to
     provision, so it propagates and aborts the whole call
  1. InstanceFactory.create_agent_level_instances — Awareness/Social/
     BasicInfo/MessageBus/Lark/HomeAssistant instances
  2. sync_agent_discovery — peer-discovery registration
  3. apply_bootstrap(profile) — Bootstrap.md + greeting + auto-delete rule
  4. SkillMarketplaceService.install_defaults — fire-and-forget default
     skills (the step pre-open review #3 flagged as missing from the MCP
     tool copy)
  5. seed the caller-supplied `awareness` text onto the AwarenessModule
     instance from step 1, if the caller passed one
