@description: Broken-pointer recovery for artifacts (the "heal" flow).

Under the pointer model an artifact row can outlive its on-disk entry file
(agent moved/deleted the file, legacy NULL-file_path rows, a register killed
mid-flight). The raw route answers 410 for such rows; the frontend calls heal
to try to reconnect the pointer.

Extracted from `backend/routes/agents/artifacts.py` (2026-07-21) so the
recovery strategy is plain, testable service logic instead of living inside
an HTTP handler.

    Recovery sequence (each step short-circuits on success):

    1. If the existing `file_path` is set AND the file is on disk: the
       pointer is actually fine — return recovered=True. Useful when the
       frontend's 410 race was a transient miss.
    2. If `entry_path` is given: caller already picked a candidate —
       re-register onto this artifact_id with that path. This is the
       "user picked from the modal" path. A rejected path propagates as
       ArtifactError so the caller can surface the cause.
    3. Scan the artifact's own root for files whose extension matches the
       artifact kind. Sort by mtime desc, cap at `_HEAL_MAX_CANDIDATES`.
       - 1 candidate → auto-register and return recovered=True.
       - 0 candidates → recovered=False, empty list.
       - >1 candidates → recovered=False, list returned so the caller can
         let the user pick.

    All three steps are scoped to `search_root`, which is the TEAM's shared
    folder for a team artifact and the agent's own workspace otherwise. Every
    step was originally written when only the latter existed, and each broke
    in a different way once team artifacts were required to live in the team
    folder: step 1 declared an intact pointer broken, step 3 offered the
    agent's unrelated private files as replacements for a team artifact, and
    both registrations dropped `team_id` and so failed the ownership check
    with "artifact not found". Together that made recovery of a team artifact
    impossible rather than merely awkward, which is why the root is derived
    once here and every step reads it.

    All registrations go through `registration.register_artifact` with
    `target_artifact_id=artifact_id` so kind/path/sanity-cap rules stay
    identical to the MCP tool and manual-register flows.

    Raises:
        ArtifactNotFound: artifact_id missing or owned by another agent.
        ArtifactError: the explicitly picked entry_path was rejected.
