@description: Create / update URL-tab artifacts (application/x-url).

A URL tab is an ordinary pointer artifact whose entry file is a small JSON
doc (UrlArtifactDoc) at `tabs/<slug>/page.url.json` in the agent workspace.
This module owns the doc I/O + orchestration; registration itself goes through
the shared `registration.register_artifact` so URL tabs get heal / delete /
bundle / raw-serving for free.

Each URL tab lives in its OWN subdirectory so the raw route's artifact-root
isolation means one tab can never read another tab's json.

No DB column for the URL — the JSON doc is the source of truth (pointer model
preserved). Updating the embed decision = rewriting the doc.
