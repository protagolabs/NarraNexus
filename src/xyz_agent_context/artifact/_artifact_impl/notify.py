@description: Staging chokepoint for artifact_changed events (the outbox).

Every registry write — register, target re-register (including the dedup
in-place branch), delete, heal repoint — calls stage_artifact_event right
after its DB write succeeds. Rows land in instance_artifact_events;
BackgroundRun drains them after each tool-output event and re-emits through
the recorder+broadcaster pipeline, so the frontend learns about registry
changes from the backend instead of grepping tool names out of the chat
stream (spec 2026-08-18-artifact-events-inventory-pointer §3).

Two contract lines shape everything here:
- Best-effort: the registry write OWNS success. A staging failure logs a
  warning and vanishes — the frontend full-pull on open/switch/reconnect is
  the self-healing floor, so a lost event is a delay, never corruption.
- The payload is the FULL artifact row, file_path included. The HTTP list
  routes already return file_path to the authenticated owner, so excluding
  it here would not hide anything — it would only split the frontend store
  into two Artifact shapes (HtmlRenderer branches on file_path), which is
  fragility without secrecy. One wire shape, same as the routes.
