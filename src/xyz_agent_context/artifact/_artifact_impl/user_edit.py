@description: The user-edit save pipeline — the ONE commit path for edits made
by a human on an artifact editing surface (resident editor / md block editor /
html per-element commit).

Shape of a save (spec A §3):
  base_hash optimistic lock  →  atomic write (temp + os.replace)  →
  pointer row refresh (hash / size / updated_at; file_path UNCHANGED)  →
  history action="user_edited"  →  staged "updated" event.

The lock compares against the DISK, not the table fingerprint: disk is truth,
and an external writer may have changed the file after our last commit point.
A stale table hash must not let a save silently overwrite that external edit.
