        A thin seam over ``NarrativeRetrieval.record_pool_only`` so the failure
        boundary is one named place rather than a bare try/except inline in
        ``select``. It exists to be monkeypatched off in the invariance test:
        that test runs the same turn with and without it and asserts the
        decided fields are identical, which is the property that makes this an
        instrument rather than a change.

        ``session`` is NOT Optional here. Reaching this branch requires
        ``narratives`` to be non-empty, and the only assignment to it is guarded
        by ``if is_continuous and session and session.current_narrative_id``, so
        both are known-true. The old ``if session else None`` was a branch that
        could never be taken, and the missing annotation is what hid that.

        path genuinely can be reached without a session.)

        ``is_user_chat`` is always True here — the call site guards on it —
        so ``evaluate_bypass``'s background_scope branch is unreachable on
        this chain. The parameter stays so that re-opening background turns
        later is a one-line change to the guard, not a plumbing change.

        The except clause is one log line and nothing else. It used to reset the
        nine fields the recorder writes, from a list kept by hand, which was
        already missing ``gate_reason`` on the day it was written and did not
        roll back snapshots at all (leaving orphan rows in
