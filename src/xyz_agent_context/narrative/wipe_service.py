@description: Full "clear conversation & memory" wipe for one (agent, user).

Why this exists
---------------
The long-memory surface is NOT only the database. Narrative bodies live as
markdown on disk (`settings.narrative_markdown_path/<agent>/<user>/narratives`)
and every turn is written as a trajectory JSON
(`settings.trajectory_path/...`). The DB `narratives`/`events` rows are an
index that is rebuilt from those files on restart. So a DB-only "clear
history" left the agent remembering everything after the next restart — the
exact bug this service fixes.

Scoping / multi-tenant correctness
-----------------------------------
An agent is single-owner (`agents.created_by`), so the caller (the owner) is
clearing their own agent. That makes `agent_id` a safe scoping key.

- Conversation tables scope by narrative_id (only the caller's narratives),
  event_id (their events' stream frames), or the agent's ChatModule instances.
- The unified `memory_*` tables carry only `agent_id + scope_type + scope_id`
  (no user_id, no narrative_id — see schema_registry `_memory_kind_table`), so
  they can only be cleared by `agent_id`. That is intended for a full wipe.

IM conversation history IS cleared under `conversations`, and since 2026-08-17
it lives in `inbox_threads` / `inbox_thread_messages` — the inbox got its own
tables and `ChannelInboxWriter` is gone, so no IM pseudo-agent, channel or
membership row is created any more. Both are wiped by `agent_id`, which the
thread row carries and which `im_thread_id` now keys on, so one agent's wipe
cannot reach another agent's record even when both talk to the same chat.

This is load-bearing twice over. The IM record is the largest content class in
the system and the frontend renders it directly (`/api/agent-inbox`), so a wipe
that missed it would report success while the whole Lark/Telegram/WeChat
conversation stayed visible in the panel. And Telegram/WeChat read
`inbox_thread_messages` back as their conversation memory, so a "cleared" agent
would still recall everything — the same reason the bus mirror had to go.

`bus_messages` is still cleared for channels where this agent is the SOLE member,
because deployed databases still hold pre-2026-08-17 IM rows written by the old
writer. Channels shared with other agents are left untouched (deleting them
would corrupt other members' history). The channel bindings/membership
(`bus_channels`, `bus_channel_members`) are kept so the agent keeps receiving new
messages; only the message rows go.

NOTE the platform caveat: the IM platform (Lark/Telegram/WeChat) still holds
the real messages on ITS servers. This wipe clears NarraNexus's local mirror
and the agent's memory; it cannot delete anything on Lark. A tool that calls
the Lark API directly can still read history there.

Deliberately NOT touched: `inbox_table` (user-level, cross-agent),
`cost_records` (billing analytics), and — always — the agent's identity:
`agents`, credentials, `user_settings`, `instance_awareness` (persona), and the
system/capability `module_instances` (only `ChatModule` rows are removed).

DB is committed first (source of truth); disk deletes run after, best-effort,
each capturing its error so a filesystem hiccup never rolls back the DB. The
whole operation is idempotent — a second call is a no-op returning zeroes.
