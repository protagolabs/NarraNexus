    # NOTE (2026-05-20 short-term-memory continuity fix): the session timeout
    # was REMOVED. The session is the continuity anchor for the user's chat
    # box — the user can reply to a visible message minutes, hours, or days
    # later (e.g. answering a question the agent sent from a scheduled job),
    # so the anchor must persist indefinitely. Sessions are one tiny,
    # overwritten-in-place file per (agent, user); they do not grow without
    # bound, so there is nothing to time out. (Was SESSION_TIMEOUT = 600.)
    # The fast path (step_1_fast_select) honors the same rule: a live
    # anchor is reused regardless of age. It briefly reintroduced a
    # 30-minute window (2026-08-14) — removed the same day for exactly
    # the reason above.

    # High-confidence gate — see _narrative_impl/routing_gate.py for the full
    # rationale. Both conditions must hold before BM25 is trusted to route a
    # turn without LLM arbitration.
    #
    # Replaces NARRATIVE_MATCH_HIGH_THRESHOLD = 0.70, which compared the
    # SQUASHED score s/(s+1) and so meant "raw >= 2.33" — cleared by incidental
    # CJK character collisions. Measured on 113 real prod turns across 22
    # agents, that rule short-circuited 86.7% of routing decisions, i.e. the
    # LLM arbitration tier was effectively dead code.
    #
    # RAW_FLOOR is a NOISE filter, deliberately low — NOT a strength test.
    # Raw BM25 scales with query length (measured median top1: 5.3 for queries
    # under 40 chars vs 12-15 for over 40), so a high absolute floor
    # systematically rejects short follow-up turns regardless of whether the
    # match is right — and short follow-ups are exactly where misrouting hurts.
    # The MARGIN does the discrimination: within one query all candidates share
    # an IDF table, so the spread is meaningful even though the absolute value
    # is not.
    #
    # MARGIN_RATIO is set on an asymmetric cost: a false defer costs one helper
    # LLM call and the LLM usually confirms; a false accept poisons the thread
    # and gets locked in for several turns by the `continuous` path, which
    # re-uses session.current_narrative_id with no topic check. Prefer
    # deferring. At 2.0 the eval set short-circuits 54.9% of turns.
    NARRATIVE_MATCH_RAW_FLOOR = 3.0
    NARRATIVE_MATCH_MARGIN_RATIO = 2.0

    # Fast-path (TurnProfile bm25_top1) anchor-override floor.
    # The fast path has no continuity LLM: when the session carries a live
    # anchor (current_narrative_id), that thread is reused by default and a
    # BM25 top-1 may steal the turn away from it ONLY above this raw score.
    # Deliberately high — raw BM25 scales with query length (median top1:
    # ~5.3 under 40 chars vs 12-15 over, see RAW_FLOOR note above), so short
    # follow-ups can never clear it and stay in their thread, while a long,
    # topic-rich message that decisively matches another thread still
    # switches. Distinct from RAW_FLOOR, which is a noise filter for the
    # anchorless case. Env override: NARRATIVE_FAST_ANCHOR_OVERRIDE_FLOOR
    #
    # NOTE (2026-08-14, measured): with a live anchor the fast path never
    # CREATES a narrative. Two "trusted silence ⇒ new topic" gates were
    # tried and measured against real BM25 distributions: a 40-char gate
    # never opened for CJK (complete zh sentences are 11-15 chars), and a
    # script-independent 8-unit gate fragmented one coherent 7-turn zh
    # conversation into 5 narratives (on-topic zh continuations score
    # 1.0-3.2 — straddling RAW_FLOOR — and >=8-unit pure ACKs like
    # "嗯嗯我明白了那就这样吧" probe as silence). BM25 cannot separate
    # "new topic" from "elliptical continuation" in CJK, and the error
    # asymmetry decides: a misfiled turn is recoverable (the next
    # full-path turn re-routes via continuity; switch_narrative exists),
    # a fragmented thread is not (permanent split + an empty ChatModule
    # history for the agent mid-conversation). New threads under fast

    # `pool_is_shadow` is 0 on every row, which is INDISTINGUISHABLE in the

    # off therefore reads as "the shutter has no releasable population on
    # continuity turns" rather than "we did not look". If you turn it off,
    # write down the window — the table cannot tell you afterwards.
    # Even with the switch ON, background-triggered continuation turns
    # (job / message_bus / IM webhook, ~30% of dev turns) stay 0 by scope —
    # the instrument records user-chat turns only. Population queries must
    # pair this column with `is_user_chat`. Coverage over ALL continuation
    # turns will sit meaningfully below 100% by design (chat is 69% and

    # ==================== Default buckets (C-1 governance) ====================
    # The eight seeded "default" narratives (GreetingAndCourtesy, …) stop being
    # routing CONTAINERS when this is False — they leave the BM25 pool, leave
    # the judge's candidate menu, and are no longer seeded for new (agent,user)
    # pairs. The verdict "this turn carries no durable topic" survives as
    # `matched_category = "no_durable_topic"`. (The eight names were initially
    # kept in the judge prompts as recognition vocabulary; 2026-08-21 live
    # testing showed the taxonomy itself teaching classify-and-dump, so the
    # names are gone from ALL prompts — pinned by
    # test_judge_instructions_dropped_the_eight_category_names.)
    #
    # Why they had to go (measured, spec 2026-08-14-default-bucket-governance):
    #   - 26.4% of prod user turns and 27.0% of a real prod slice's chat turns
    #     had a bucket as their MAIN narrative, and 9080/9080 buckets platform-
    #     wide still carry their factory summary — a bucket never accumulates a
    #     retrieval surface, so a topic filed into one can never be recalled.
    #   - The eight rows also perturbed 9.7% of top-1 BM25 results just by
    #     sitting in the pool (IDF/avgdl are computed over the set handed in).
    #
    # False is the shipping value. Flipping to True restores the CONTAINER
    # side only (seeding, pool, menu offer) — it does NOT bring back the old
    # taxonomy-carrying prompts, which were removed separately on 2026-08-21;
    # a FULL rollback to the old world is this flag PLUS reverting the two
    # taxonomy-removal prompt commits. Existing bucket ROWS are never deleted
    # either way — binding rule #6.

    # ==================== Merged routing (one call, four answers) ==========

    # this continue the thread?" then "so where does it go?").
    #
    # Why it is worth a flag at all (prod, 7 days, is_user_chat=1, n=189):
    # 43 turns paid for BOTH calls, at a serial p50 of 8,924ms / mean 13,004ms.
    # The non-LLM half of routing is 47.6ms mean — there is nothing else in
    # there to fix, so the only lever is the number of round trips.
    #
    # ROLLBACK IS THE FLAG, and it rolls back exactly one thing: the ROUTING
    # STRUCTURE (who decides, and in what order). Flipping it back to "0"
    # restores the continuity → judge pair and stops the merged prompt from
    # being built; it does NOT undo anything else in this batch, and nothing

    #   * the merged prompt constants are a NEW file section, unreferenced when
    #     the flag is off;

    #     tier's and the judge's text byte for byte — pinned by test;
    #   * the audit columns are additive and simply stay NULL.
