        `description` is written once at creation from the raw triggering input
        and is never rewritten by the updater, yet it sits in the BM25 index and
        in the continuity prompt. Measured on all 1,381 non-default prod
        narratives (2026-08-20): **291 (21.1%) are over 1,500 characters and the
        longest is 198,398** — a thread born on a 5KB scheduled-task prompt has
        that 5KB welded into its retrieval surface forever. BM25 computes IDF and
        avgdl over the candidate pool itself, so one such document both crushes
        every normal candidate's length normalisation and hands itself a large
        pool of matchable tokens: offline re-scoring of 630 real decisions put
        the bypass rate at 41.0% for pools containing one against 14.5% without.

        FULL RETIREMENT, not truncate-and-keep-reading. A truncated fossil is
        still a fossil: it still asserts, in the present tense, a topic the
        thread may have left months ago.

        The condition is "the thread has a REAL summary", NOT "the updater has
        run": the updater is async and can fail, so a thread born during a
        helper outage never gets one. Keying on the record rather than on the

        retires; record stillborn, birth certificate keeps standing in and the

        "Real" excludes the creation placeholders (see
        `PROVISIONAL_SUMMARY_PREFIXES`): `NarrativeCRUD.create` pre-fills
        `current_summary`, so a literal non-empty test would retire the birth
        certificate at the instant of birth and defeat the self-healing branch
        entirely.
