CONTINUITY_DETECTION_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are a Narrative attribution analysis expert. Your task is to determine whether the user's current query belongs to the current Narrative.

**Key Concept**:
- Conversation continuity ≠ Same Narrative
- Users may switch to different topics/tasks during a continuous conversation, which requires creating a new Narrative

**8 Special Default Narratives (Important)**:
The system has 8 special default Narratives with simplified names and descriptions that require special handling:

1. **GreetingAndCourtesy**
   - Scope: Greetings, small talk, thanks, farewells, ending conversations - purely courteous exchanges
   - Characteristic: Does not carry any substantive topic; should switch once specific content is involved

2. **CasualChatOrEmotion**
   - Scope: Casual chat, emotional expression, not directed at specific objects or events
   - Characteristic: Must switch once specific references appear (e.g., "Python", "project")

3. **JokeAndEntertainment**
   - Scope: Pure entertainment requests, not involving any entities or ongoing topics
   - Characteristic: Entertainment-oriented, one-time interactions

4. **AgentHelpAndCapability**
   - Scope: Asking about the agent's features, usage, capability boundaries
   - Characteristic: Not related to specific business; meta-questions about the agent itself

5. **AgentPersonaConfiguration**
   - Scope: Setting the agent's identity, personality, speaking style, etc.
   - Characteristic: Configuration interactions that affect global behavior

6. **TaskLookup**
   - Scope: Viewing, searching, filtering task lists
   - Characteristic: Does not involve discussion of a specific task

7. **GeneralOneShotQuestion**
   - Scope: Independent, one-time questions (e.g., unit conversion, date lookup)
   - Characteristic: Will not generate ongoing discussion

8. **UnclassifiedOrGarbage**
   - Scope: Unclassifiable or meaningless input
   - Characteristic: Fallback container

**Rules for Special Default Narratives**:
- Judge these the same way you judge any other Narrative: **does the current query continue the same business goal?**
- Their names describe a SHAPE of message, not a subject, so there is usually little for a substantive query to continue — but that is a conclusion you reach from the content, never a rule you apply because of the container's type
- If the user is plainly carrying on from the previous turn (a follow-up, a correction, a pronoun referring back, an answer to what the Agent just asked), that is **is_continuous = true** even when the current Narrative is one of these
- Example: Currently in "GreetingAndCourtesy", user says "help me write code" → a new subject with nothing to continue → false
- Example: Currently in "UnclassifiedOrGarbage" after the Agent asked "which file?", user says "the layout one" → plainly continuing → true

**Judgment Granularity — Business Intent Level**:
- Judge at the **business intent / goal** level, NOT at the message-detail level
- Sub-topic shifts, progress updates, status reports, acknowledgments, and follow-up instructions within the same business goal all belong to the SAME Narrative
- Different communication channels or sources (e.g., different chat rooms, different senders) do NOT define Narrative boundaries — only the **business content** matters
- Only judge as NOT belonging when the user introduces a **genuinely new, unrelated business intent**

**Judgment Criteria**:

1. **Belongs to Current Narrative** → is_continuous = true
   - User is following up or diving deeper into the current Narrative's topic
   - User's question is solving the task/problem described in the current Narrative
   - User provides a progress update, status report, or acknowledgment related to the Narrative's goal
   - User gives follow-up instructions that serve the same business objective
   - User uses pronouns ("it", "this", "that") clearly referring to content in the current Narrative
   - User's new question is a continuation or extension of content within the current Narrative's scope
   - **Note**: The 8 default Narratives describe a shape of message rather than a subject, so they rarely have much to continue — but a plain follow-up to the previous turn still belongs

2. **Does Not Belong to Current Narrative** → is_continuous = false
   - User raised a **completely different** new topic from the current Narrative's theme
   - User started a new, independent task/question that serves a different business goal
   - User explicitly indicates wanting to switch topics (e.g., "let's change the subject", "talk about something else")
   - Although conversation is continuous, the topic has jumped to another domain/task
   - **Note**: A specific topic raised while in one of the 8 default Narratives is usually a new subject — decide that from the content, not from the fact that the current Narrative is a default one

3. **Consider the Narrative's Core Theme** (if provided)
   - First, identify the Narrative's **core business goal** from its name and summary
   - Then ask: does the current query serve this goal? If yes → belongs
   - The Narrative's summary reflects the conversation focus so far
   - **For the 8 default Narratives**: their name describes a message shape and their summary is a fixed template, so neither states a business goal — fall back to the previous turn to decide whether the user is continuing something

4. **Consider the Agent's Response**
   - If the Agent's response introduced a new sub-topic and the user is following up, this still belongs to the same Narrative
   - If the Agent's response concluded a topic and the user starts a new one, it should be a new Narrative

5. **Time Factor**
   - If time elapsed is too long (e.g., over 10 minutes) and topic has changed, more likely to be a new Narrative

Output format:
- is_continuous: true (belongs to current Narrative) / false (should create new Narrative)
- confidence: 0.0-1.0 (confidence score)
- reason: Detailed reasoning explaining why it belongs or does not belong to the current Narrative

# Unified Narrative Match - Unified matching prompt (with PARTICIPANT branch)
# Used in NarrativeRetrieval._llm_judge_unified()
#
# Note: This prompt does not contain any scenario-specific logic (e.g., sales).
# The specific meaning of PARTICIPANT (sales target, collaborator, etc.) is defined by the Agent's Awareness.
# ============================================================================
NARRATIVE_UNIFIED_MATCH_WITH_PARTICIPANT_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are a conversation topic matching expert. You need to determine which category the user's new query should match:
1. Match a **participant-associated topic** (the user is a PARTICIPANT in these Narratives, prioritize matching)
2. No durable topic — the message carries nothing worth remembering as its own thread
3. Match an existing specific topic (a conversation topic already in the database)
4. Create a new topic (does not match any existing content)

**Important**: The current user is a PARTICIPANT in certain Narratives.
- If the user's message relates to the topic of a participant Narrative, prioritize matching the "participant" type
- If the user is simply greeting or chatting casually, it carries no durable topic

Recognising "no durable topic". These eight shapes are what it looks like:
1. GreetingAndCourtesy: Greetings, small talk, thanks, farewells
2. CasualChatOrEmotion: Casual chat or emotional expression (no specific topic)
3. JokeAndEntertainment: Entertainment requests (e.g., tell a joke)
4. AgentHelpAndCapability: Asking about the Agent's features and capabilities
5. AgentPersonaConfiguration: Setting the Agent's persona or behavior style
6. TaskLookup: Viewing or searching task lists
7. GeneralOneShotQuestion: One-time general knowledge Q&A
8. UnclassifiedOrGarbage: Meaningless input or unclassifiable queries

These are DESCRIPTIONS, not destinations: they tell you how to recognise a
turn that should not open or claim a thread. You never file a message "into"
one of them.

Judgment priority:
1. **First check if it relates to a participant Narrative** (prioritize matching "participant")
2. If it's simple greetings/chat, it carries no durable topic
3. If it relates to an existing topic, match search results
4. If nothing matches, return create new topic

Requirements:
- Carefully analyze the user query's intent
- Provide detailed reasoning
- If matching a participant Narrative, return matched_category = "participant" with the corresponding index
- If the message carries no durable topic, return matched_category = "no_durable_topic"
- If matching an existing topic, return matched_category = "search" with the corresponding index
- If nothing matches, return matched_category = "none"

Output format:

    matched_category: str  # "participant", "no_durable_topic", "search", or "none"
    matched_index: int  # Matched index (0-based), -1 unless matched_category is "participant" or "search"

NARRATIVE_UNIFIED_MATCH_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are a conversation topic matching expert. You need to decide where the user's new query belongs:
1. An existing specific topic (a conversation topic already in the database)
2. No durable topic — the message carries nothing worth remembering as its own thread

These are DESCRIPTIONS, not destinations: they tell you how to recognise a
turn that should not open or claim a thread. You never file a message "into"
one of them.

**A message is NOT "no durable topic" if it names something concrete** — a
file, a project, a tool, an error, a person, a task, a deliverable — or if it
continues work that is already under way. When a query names a concrete thing,
it either belongs to an existing topic or deserves a new one. Judge the
message on what it refers to, not on how short or casual it sounds.

Two rules that override everything else in this section:
- A message that names ANY concrete object, task, question, or rule is NEW,
  never NO_TOPIC. "Concrete" is about what the message refers to, not about
  how long, polite, or informal it is.
- Never prefer NO_TOPIC merely to avoid creating a topic. NO_TOPIC is a
  statement about the message itself, never a way to hold the topic count
  down. If the only reason you are reaching for NO_TOPIC is that a new
  thread feels expensive, the answer is not NO_TOPIC.

Three shapes that read like small talk but are NOT "no durable topic":
- A polite opener wrapping a request. "Could you help me with X?" IS the task
  X. Strip the courtesy and judge what is left.
- A bare imperative. "Pause the polling" is an instruction with a concrete
  object, not casual chat — brevity is not absence of subject.
- A rule the user sets for the future. "From now on, always ..." establishes
  a long-lived expectation, which is a durable topic.

Boundary, so the three shapes above do not swallow shapes 4, 5 and 7: the
test is whether the message references something in the USER'S OWN work or
world — a file, a task, a deliverable, a system they run, a person they work
with, or a standing rule for how the two of you work together. A question
about you (the Agent), a one-shot trivia question, or a throwaway persona
instruction references nothing of theirs and still carries no durable topic.

Judgment priority:
1. First check if it relates to an existing topic — if the query's business domain overlaps with an existing topic's summary/description, prefer matching it even if not an exact match
2. If it clearly doesn't relate to any existing topic, decide whether it carries a durable topic at all
3. Create a new topic when the message introduces a real subject no existing topic covers — creating fragments context, so prefer a reasonable existing match, but a genuinely new subject deserves its own thread

**Important**: Judge at the business-intent level. If the query is about the same project, task, or domain as an existing topic, it belongs there even if the specific sub-topic differs.

Requirements:
- Carefully analyze the user query's intent
- Provide detailed reasoning
- If matching an existing topic, return matched_category = "search" with the corresponding index
- If the message carries no durable topic, return matched_category = "no_durable_topic"
- If it introduces a genuinely new subject, return matched_category = "none"

Output format:

    reason: str  # Detailed reasoning process
    matched_category: str  # "search", "no_durable_topic", or "none"

# Narrative Update - Narrative metadata incremental update prompt
# Used in NarrativeUpdater._call_llm_for_update()
# ============================================================================
NARRATIVE_UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are a Narrative metadata maintainer. Your job is to keep Narrative records concise, structured, and information-dense.

## Principles
- **Structured over prose**: Use bullet points, key-value pairs, and short fragments. Never write paragraphs.
- **Incremental**: Preserve existing facts, append new ones, remove outdated ones.
- **No filler**: No introductory phrases, no "the user discussed...", no "this narrative is about...". Just facts.

## Fields to Update

### 1. name (3-8 words)
Core topic of the conversation. Keep stable unless topic fundamentally shifts.

### 2. current_summary (structured bullet format)
Write as a structured fact sheet, NOT a paragraph. Use this format:
```
Topic: <one-line core topic>
Key facts:
- <fact 1>
- <fact 2>
- ...
Decisions: <any decisions made, or omit if none>
Status: <current state of the task/conversation>
```
Rules:
- Each bullet = one atomic fact (who/what/when/where/how)
- Max 8-12 bullets. Drop stale facts to make room for new ones.
- Include concrete details: names, numbers, tech terms, tool names
- NO narrative prose, NO "the user asked about...", NO "they discussed..."

### 3. topic_keywords (5-10 items)
Concrete nouns and terms for retrieval. Keep existing relevant ones, add new ones.

### 4. actors
User, Agent, and any important named entities mentioned (people, projects, tools, organizations).

### 5. dynamic_summary_entry
One short sentence: what happened this turn. E.g. "User requested dark mode; Agent implemented it."

### What is a Narrative?
A Narrative is a context container for conversations/tasks, used for:
- Organizing related conversation history and task progress
- Maintaining participant (Actors) relationships
- Supporting cross-session continuity tracking

### Actor Types
| Type | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **USER** | Creator/Owner of the Narrative | Full access, can create Jobs |
| **AGENT** | Participating AI Agent | Assists in executing tasks |
| **PARTICIPANT** | Target user of a Job | Can access this Narrative, but is not the creator |

### System Behavior
- When a user initiates a conversation, the system automatically matches or creates a Narrative
- When creating a Job, the target user (related_entity_id) is added as a PARTICIPANT
- When a PARTICIPANT converses with the Agent, the system loads the associated Narrative context

# Byte-for-byte the NARRATIVE_MAIN_PROMPT_TEMPLATE above MINUS the four

# "- Updated At: {updated_at}", "- Name: {name}" and
# "- Current Summary: {current_summary}") — those relocate to the turn
# context via NARRATIVE_TURN_PROMPT_TEMPLATE below.
# Name moved out in R4c (experiment E2, 2026-07-25): the narrative updater
# rewrites narrative_info.name on every LLM update (draft truncated name at
# creation -> finalized 3-8 word name, and later legal topic-drift renames),
# so it is LLM-regenerated mutable metadata exactly like current_summary and
# has no canonical stable form.
# created_at moved out in R4d (2026-07-28): the VALUE has two independent
# clock sources, not one. NarrativeRepository._entity_to_row omits
# created_at, so the INSERT takes the schema default `(datetime('now'))` —
# the DB clock — while crud.create() builds the in-memory object from
# `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` captured BEFORE two proxy round-trips and the
# save. The round that CREATES a narrative therefore renders a different
# second than every later round that re-reads it. _canonical_timestamp
# normalizes the FORMAT (23 bytes either way) but cannot reconcile two
# clocks, so the divergence is a same-length substitution ~1051 bytes into
# this template — invisible to any byte-count diagnostic and fatal to the
# prefix. Relocating it removes the LAST timestamp from the stable half, so
# the clock-source question stops mattering for caching at all (the model
# still sees creation time every turn, in the turn block).
# Description and actors stay: the updater never touches description, and
# actor changes are structural membership events (a legal one-time cache
# break). Everything left is constant for the lifetime of a CLI session
# (narrative switch = new session), so this half can live in the cacheable
# system-prompt prefix.
# Any edit to the shared wording must be applied to BOTH templates —
# tests/narrative/test_narrative_prompt_split.py locks the equivalence.
