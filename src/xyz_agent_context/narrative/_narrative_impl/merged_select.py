@description: Orchestration of the merged routing path — one decision per
              turn: BM25 first, then a shutter or ONE LLM call.

Moved out of NarrativeService on review (2026-08-27, Important #2): the
service file had grown past the 800-line bound with two 250-line deciders
side by side, and every verdict branch hand-assigned six loose locals. Here
each landing is a small function returning a frozen ``Landing`` (defined in
landings.py so the flag-off path can use it without importing this module's
helper-SDK chain) — six fields constructed at once, so a new
``NarrativeSelectionResult`` field cannot be silently defaulted on one
verdict and set on another.

The service keeps a thin ``_select_merged`` delegate; ``is_reusable_anchor``
and ``minutes_since`` stay ONE definition each (anchor_rules.py), shared with
``select()``, ``_land_no_topic_turn`` and ``step_1_fast_select``.

    WHY (reference/self_notebook/specs/2026-08-25-merged-routing-design.md §4)

    The two-call path asks continuity ("does this continue?") and then, if
    that says no, the judge ("so where does it go?"). Prod, 7 days,
    is_user_chat=1, n=189: 43 turns paid for both, serial p50 8,924ms / mean
    13,004ms, while the entire non-LLM half of routing is 47.6ms mean. The
    only lever with anything behind it is the number of round trips.

    THE DECIDER CHANGES, THE EXECUTORS DO NOT

    Every landing below is a pre-existing code path: the continuity landing
    (return the anchor), `assemble_match_landing` (the judge's own search
    landing), `load_participant_landing`, `create_from_query`,
    `_land_no_topic_turn`. Downstream — step_1, step_4, the ChatModule —
    reads `narratives` / `is_new` / `no_durable_topic` / `retrieval_method`
    and never branches on `selection_method`, so nothing outside this path
    learns there was a change.

    WHAT THIS OPENS, AND WHAT PAYS FOR IT (§3.2)

    On the two-call path a continuity turn returned before the retrieval
    tier: no pool, no menu, no way for a foreign thread to reach a prompt.
    That was an unnamed defence, and it is the one that held the p07 hijack
    specimen for eleven turns. Merging removes it, so the anchored thread is
    injected into the prompt unconditionally and deduplicated out of the
    menu, and `anchor_bm25_rank` / `anchor_in_menu` are recorded on every row
    so the compensation can actually be measured in production instead of
    assumed.
