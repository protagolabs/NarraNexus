@description: Decide whether BM25 evidence is strong enough to route a turn
without asking the LLM.

Split out of `retrieval.retrieve_top_k` so the decision is a pure function over
numbers: it is the one piece of narrative routing that must be tunable against
an offline eval set, and it was previously three inline conditions tangled with
DB loads and candidate assembly.

WHY THE OLD RULE FAILED (prod 2026-07-29, agent_dd505db5ff12)

`keyword_search` squashes raw BM25 through ``s / (s + 1)`` and the gate
compared that to 0.70. That is algebraically ``raw >= 2.33`` — and under the
per-character CJK tokenizer (Chinese has no spaces, so `tokenize` emits
unigrams) a handful of incidental character collisions clears it. `工业` and
`武道具` share 业; `高铁新城` and `高井武道具` share 高. Measured against that
agent's real narratives, 5 of 5 queries cleared the gate and skipped LLM
arbitration — including "帮我查一下明天上海的天气怎么样", which relates to
none of its narratives. Routing was effectively random but confident, and the
one layer that could have caught it was skipped precisely when the bogus score
was highest.

WHY TWO CONDITIONS, NOT ONE

Raw BM25 carries no cross-corpus meaning here: `bm25_rank` computes IDF on the
candidate set itself, which is 5-12 narratives, so the same overlap yields
different numbers for different agents. An absolute floor alone is therefore
arbitrary.

Within a single query, though, the SPREAD is meaningful — both candidates saw
the same IDF table. A true hit pulls away from the field; noise matches bunch
up. The prod five normalised to 0.970 / 0.903 / 0.894 / 0.781: all crowded.

So both must hold:
  - floor  kills "everything is weak, pick the least weak"
  - margin kills "everything is strong-ish, pick arbitrarily"

Failing the gate is not an error and not a fallback — it routes to
`_llm_unified_match`, which already exists, is the only semantic check in the
pipeline, and currently runs on ~4% of turns. Sending more traffic there is the
point.

# ── the second decision: may this turn skip review at all? ──────────────────
#
# The gate above answers "is the BM25 evidence strong?". That question turned
# out to be unanswerable with an absolute number: `bm25_rank` estimates IDF on
# the candidate set, so on prod (26,922 audit rows, 2026-08-14..20, replayed
# byte-exact) ONE query text — `[From Liam] 👊`, 99 turns, same agent — scored
#
#     pool 19 -> 5.66   26 -> 3.35   34 -> 2.41   67 -> 1.09   100 -> 0.02
#
# i.e. RAW_FLOOR=3.0 flips between pool 26 and 34 on identical evidence.
# Gating on the strongest single term instead of the sum does not help: that
# statistic swings 2.89 -> 0.01 across the same range, because it is built from
# the same per-pool IDF. 51.8% of prod decisions are dominated by a term with
# in-pool df = 1, which in a 9-document pool is noise, not rarity.
#
# The RISK, though, is not spread across those numbers. Classifying every prod
# bypass by what it actually did to the conversation:
#
#     staying in the anchored thread   9,229   92.5%
#     switching to another thread        353    3.5%
#     no anchor at all (first turn)      392    3.9%
#
# Thread hijacking can only come from the last two — and B-7 p07 showed what it
# costs: one wrong verdict held 20 of 22 turns in a stranger's thread while the
# updater rewrote that thread's identity until the lexical evidence agreed.
#
# So the necessary condition is structural, not numeric: A BYPASS MAY ONLY KEEP
# A TURN WHERE IT ALREADY WAS. It reads no score, so it cannot drift with pool
# size or query length — of every design measured it is the only one with zero
# cross-pool verdict flips.
