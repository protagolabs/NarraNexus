@description: One helper call that answers both routing questions — "does this
message continue the thread?" and "if not, where does it go?".

WHY (specs/2026-08-25-merged-routing-design.md §2-§4)

The two questions were two serial LLM calls. On prod (7 days, is_user_chat=1,
n=189) 43 turns paid for both, at a serial p50 of 8,924ms; the entire non-LLM
half of routing is 47.6ms mean. So the only lever with anything behind it is the
NUMBER OF ROUND TRIPS, and the two questions share almost all of their input.

WHAT THIS FILE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR, AND WHAT IT IS NOT

It builds one prompt and parses one answer. It does not decide where a turn
lands: `NarrativeService._select_merged` owns that, and every landing it uses is
a pre-existing executor (the continuity landing, the judge's match landing,
`create_from_query`, `_land_no_topic_turn`). The decider changes; the executors
do not.

THE STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINT THAT SHAPES THE PROMPT (§3.2)

On the two-call path, a continuity turn returns BEFORE the retrieval tier: no
pool, no menu, no way for a foreign thread to reach any prompt. Merging opens
that door on every turn — and the measurement says what is behind it. On
continuity turns the anchored thread is NOT in the BM25 top-3 in 26.2%-71.6% of
turns, the menu's first row is a foreign thread in 26.4%-93.8% (78-97% of those
being seeded distractor threads), and the anchor scores literally zero in
8.2%-49.3%. The p07 hijack specimen was held by exactly the defence merging
removes: `pool=0`, BM25 never ran.

Hence: the anchor is rendered UNCONDITIONALLY, in its own section, as the
default answer, and deduplicated out of the menu. Its presence is not a
function of its score. That is data-forced, not stylistic — and
`test_merged_routing_prompt.py` fails if it ever becomes conditional again.

FAILURE IS NOT AN ANSWER

`decide` never raises and never guesses. A provider error, a timeout, a verdict
outside the contract or an index past the menu all return `ok=False`, and the
caller's fallback keeps the turn where it already was. Reading a failed call as
"new topic" is the D19 shape: the created thread becomes the anchor and the
updater rewrites it until the lexical evidence agrees.
