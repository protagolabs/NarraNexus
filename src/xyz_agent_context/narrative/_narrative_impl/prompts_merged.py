@description: The merged-routing instruction fragments and their per-turn
              composer (`build_merged_instructions`).

Split from prompts.py on review (2026-08-27 round 3, I3): the merged section
had grown to ~220 lines inside an already-long shared prompt module. The
no-durable-topic rubric stays in prompts.py — it is spliced verbatim into
the judge variants too, and THE one copy is the whole point (PR #361 round
2, I2); this module imports it.

#: Shared by every variant — nothing here presupposes a continuable anchor
#: (review round 2, C1: the asymmetry block used to live here and told every
#: variant "staying is the DEFAULT", inviting the one verdict the contract
#: refuses on anchorless/bucket turns).
_MERGED_ROUTING_CORE = """You decide, in one step, where the user's current message belongs.

**Judgment granularity — business intent level**

- Judge at the business intent / goal level, NOT at the message-detail level.
- Sub-topic shifts, progress updates, status reports, acknowledgements and
  follow-up instructions within the same business goal all belong to the SAME
  thread.
- Different channels or senders do NOT define thread boundaries — only the
  business content does.
- Only decide "different" when the user introduces a genuinely new, unrelated
  business intent.

**How to read the menu**

Each row shows which query terms matched and where. Judge on those terms: a row
carried entirely by frame words (帮/查/一/下, "the", "how", "me") is a lexical
accident, not a topic match. Word overlap is a necessary but not sufficient
condition for choosing any thread: a row must overlap to be considered, and
overlapping is not by itself a reason to choose it."""


#: Rendered only when the anchored thread is actually continuable — every
#: sentence here presupposes a thread the turn may stay on.
_MERGED_CORE_WITH_ANCHOR = """**The asymmetry — read this before anything else**

The conversation is already on a thread (shown below as the anchored thread).
Staying on that thread is the DEFAULT answer. The keyword menu is evidence for
LEAVING it, never evidence for staying: two consecutive messages in one
continuous thread routinely share no words at all, so an anchored thread that
appears nowhere in the menu — or scores nothing — is the normal case, not a
signal.

Concretely: never leave the anchored thread because a menu row looks lexically
closer. Leave it only when the message pursues a different business goal.

**The previous turn decides most of these**

- If the Agent's own reply introduced a sub-topic and the user is following up
  on it, that is still the same thread — including when the user's message
  would be unreadable without that reply ("讲第一个", "the second one", "why?").
- If the Agent's reply closed a topic and the user opens an unrelated one, that
  is not the same thread.
- Long elapsed time is weak evidence on its own; combined with a changed
  subject it points away from the anchored thread."""

#: section in the user input says WHY (absent, or a legacy container).
_MERGED_CORE_WITHOUT_ANCHOR = """**No thread to stay on — read this before anything else**

This message is not on any continuable thread (the anchor section below says
why). Place it on its own merits among the answers offered. The previous turn

"why?") — what the message is about may live entirely in that reply — and then
route the subject you find, not the words."""
