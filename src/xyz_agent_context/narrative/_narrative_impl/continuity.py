    Narrative Attribution Detector

    Uses LLM to determine whether the current Query belongs to the current Narrative.

    Notes:
    - Conversation continuity ≠ Same Narrative
    - Users may switch topics during continuous conversation, requiring a new Narrative
    - Judgment should consider the Narrative's name, description, summary, and keywords

    Special Handling:
    - The system has 8 special default Narratives (is_special="default")
    - These Narratives have very strict boundaries with simplified information
    - Once the user mentions specific objects, tasks, or ongoing topics, should switch to a new Narrative

    Example:
        >>> detector = ContinuityDetector()
        >>>
        >>> # Continuation of a regular Narrative
        >>> result = await detector.detect("tell me more about this product", session, current_narrative)
        >>> print(result.is_continuous)  # True - belongs to current Narrative
        >>>
        >>> # Switching from special Narrative to specific topic
        >>> result = await detector.detect("help me write code", session, greeting_narrative)
        >>> print(result.is_continuous)  # False - switching from greeting to specific task
