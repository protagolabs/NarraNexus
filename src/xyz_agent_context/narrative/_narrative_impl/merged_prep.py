@description: The merged path's BM25 preparation — one scoring pass, the
              anchor's counterfactual standing, and the audit's tier-2 half.

Moved out of retrieval.py on review (2026-08-27, I6): retrieval had crossed
1,400 lines and, worse, imported `merged_router` upward for `pick_menu` —
the layering said "executor depends on decider". `pick_menu` now lives in
`routing_gate` (a pure rule, like the shutter), this module owns the
merged-specific preparation, and retrieval keeps only the executors every
decider shares (`_score_pool`, the loaders, the landings).

Takes the `NarrativeRetrieval` instance as its first argument — same
collaboration shape as `merged_select`'s service argument: runtime object,
type imported under TYPE_CHECKING only, no import-time upward dependency.

    Same scoring pass as the other two callers (`_score_pool`); what differs

    path this work happened only after continuity had already said no —
    which is why the shutter's releasable population could never be
    measured, and why slice 0 had to record it separately at all.

    Fills the audit's tier-2 half in place, including ``gate_short_circuit``,
    which keeps its established meaning ("this turn skipped LLM arbitration
    because floor+margin plus identity said so"): the shutter IS that rule
    moved one tier earlier, so giving it a different column would fork one
    fact into two. Binding rule #6 cuts both ways — an existing column must
    not change meaning, and it must not silently stop accumulating either.
