    moved onto the live `narrative_info` fields. The PARTICIPANT branch kept

    froze into a write-once-at-creation tombstone — 84% empty on the local dev

    narrative described to the judge by its first sentence from three months
    earlier, and one whose label was a `[:50]` cut through the middle of an
    open_id. That branch FORCES the judge to run (a task someone invited the
    user into must not lose to a keyword hit on the user's own narrative), so
    a blind label there decides the turn.

        `retrieve_top_k` (which decides) and `record_pool_only` (which only
        records) used to be two hand-written copies of this sequence, and the
        copies had already drifted three ways in the commit that created them:
        a scoring slice of 3 against 6, a `keyword_ms` that excluded the pool
        read on one side, and a bucket precondition that only held on one.
        Slice 0's entire value is that the two populations are comparable, and
        a promise of comparability kept by hand is not kept.

        Returns everything a caller might need and writes NOTHING — no audit,
        no snapshots dict, no session. That is what lets each caller commit the
        result in a single block that cannot fail half-way (see
        `_build_pool_record`), and it is why the participant merge lives HERE
        rather than in the callers: the record must be built AFTER the merge or
        `is_participant` is permanently false for every candidate the P0-4
        rule is about, and a constraint that lives in one function cannot be
        violated by only one of two call sites.

        `rank_depth` overrides how deep the ranking is kept. The two-tier path
        needs a top-K slice and nothing more; merged routing needs the WHOLE
        scoring set, because it records where the ANCHOR placed and a truncated
        slice cannot tell "the anchor ranked below the cut" from "the anchor
        scored nothing" — one is a §3.2 data point, the other is a NULL, and
        conflating them corrupts the only production instrument that question
        has. `bm25_explain` returns only candidates that actually matched, so
        the depth is bounded by "how many threads share a word with this
        message", not by pool size.

        `_ensure_default_narratives` is deliberately NOT part of this: it
        CREATES rows, the recording path must not write business data to
        observe, and only the deciding path has a reason to seed.

        One consequence, stated conditionally because it depends on a flag:
        under `NARRATIVE_DEFAULT_BUCKETS_ENABLED=0` (the shipping value)
        buckets never enter the pool, so the recorded pool IS the pool the
        deciding path would have scored. If that flag is turned back on, a
        shadow pool for an (agent,user) that has never been seeded is missing
        the eight buckets the deciding path would have created and counted into
        IDF/avgdl. The window is narrow — a continuity turn means the previous
        turn already ran the seeding — but it is not empty: flipping the flag
        between two turns hits it.

        §2.2). This closes the gap by running the same scoring pass the real
        path runs, and handing the result to nobody.

        ALL-OR-NOTHING. Everything that can fail happens before the first line
        of the commit block below, so a failure leaves the audit row exactly as
        it was — no half-filled pool, and no orphan rows in
