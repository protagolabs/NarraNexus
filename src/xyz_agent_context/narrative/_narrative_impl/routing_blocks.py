@description: The prompt blocks narrative routing renders — ONE definition each,
shared by the continuity tier, the LLM judge, and the merged router.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS

Three tiers describe the same four things to a model: the thread the
conversation is already on, the previous turn, the BM25 menu, and the
PARTICIPANT threads. Every time one of those descriptions was copied instead of
shared, the copies drifted and only one of them got fixed:

  * the judge's search branch and its PARTICIPANT branch were two
    implementations of "what a candidate shows the model"; on 2026-04-15 only
    the search branch moved onto the live `narrative_info` fields, and the other
    spent two months labelling 72-event threads by a frozen creation-time hint;
  * the two judge prompt variants forked THREE times over the no-topic rubric,
    the last one caught in PR #361 review round 2.

The merged router adds a fourth consumer, which is exactly the moment that
pattern would repeat. So the blocks live here and the merged prompt is a
COMPOSITION of them, not a fourth copy.

BYTE-IDENTITY IS THE CONTRACT

The continuity tier and the judge must render exactly what they rendered before
this file existed — their prompts are pinned by measured numbers (M6 = 20.8%,
the P1 calibration, the description-retirement dry run), and a whitespace change
would quietly invalidate all of them. Every difference the merged path needs is
therefore a NAMED PARAMETER with the old behaviour as its default, and
`test_merged_routing_prompt.py` pins both renderings byte for byte.

READ-SIDE CLAMPS ONLY

`clamp_head` shortens what a prompt SHOWS. It never touches what is stored, and
it always keeps the head: the referent of a follow-up ("讲第一个" / "the first
one") sits at the start of the agent's previous reply, so clamping the tail
would drop the one thing the previous turn is in the prompt for. Every clamp
reports itself, because a silently shortened prompt cannot be explained after
the fact.
