@description: The executors every routing decider shares — candidate
              labelling for prompts, and the landings for match / participant
              verdicts — plus the Landing value object.

Extracted from retrieval.py on review (2026-08-27 round 3, I3): the four
methods were a cohesive unit ("change the decider, keep the executors") lost
inside a 1,300-line module, and `Landing` lived in merged_select — which
forced the flag-off path to import the whole merged module (and its
helper-SDK chain) for a six-field dataclass (M4).

`candidate_labels` moved WITH its four consumers — it is the ONE definition
of what a candidate shows a model, and it must not fork (the judge's two
branches were two copies of that decision once, and only one was fixed).

    a blind label there decides the turn.

    The decider answered a question about the TURN ("is there anything here
    worth remembering as its own thread?"); it did not name a destination.
    This is where the destination is decided, and the rule is anchor-first —
    deliberately the same shape ``step_1_fast_select`` settled on for the
    fast path, so the paths cannot drift into disagreeing about where a
    contentless turn belongs:

    1. **A live anchor on a real thread → reuse it.** A "你好" in the middle
       of a task belongs to the task (annotation protocol R1), and the user
       expects the agent to still know what they were doing. The thread's
       retrieval surface is NOT touched — see ``no_durable_topic`` on
       NarrativeSelectionResult for why a greeting must never get to rename
       the work it interrupted.
    2. **No anchor → create.** Chat history endpoints are narrative-scoped
       and the ChatModule instance hangs off the narrative, so running bare
       would make a first-contact turn vanish from the user's own history.
       The created thread is not junk: it becomes the anchor, and the updater
       renames it as the real subject emerges.

    ``anchor`` is an optimisation only (round 5, M2): the merged path already
    holds the loaded object, the flag-off path passes None and it is read
    here. Reusability is judged HERE either way — trusting a caller's
    "continuable" flag would fork the bucket rule between the two paths.

    (An `ephemeral → run bare` third branch was removed on review 2026-08-21,
    Important #2: unreachable in production — every ephemeral TurnProfile
    takes the fast path. Re-add deliberately from TurnProfile if that changes.)

    Moved from NarrativeService on review (round 5, I3): it is a landing
    executor, and its four siblings already live in this module.
