@description: The team bulletin's business rules — budgets, and what an agent
may write.

Plain functions, not MCP handlers and not route bodies, for the same reason as
`team_files.py`: these rules ARE the feature, and they should be testable
without standing up a tool server or an HTTP client.

They live in the core package rather than beside the REST routes because both
surfaces enforce them — the routes for the user, the MCP tool for an agent —
and a core module reaching into `backend.routes` to borrow them would invert
the layering the architecture depends on.

**Why an agent may write here at all.** The point of the bulletin is that a
thing gets said once. A team that works out its own convention mid-task ("we
settled on report format v2") and cannot record it forces the user back into
the role of scribe for a decision they were not part of.

**Why the authority is asymmetric.** An agent may add, and may retract WHAT IT
ITSELF WROTE. It may never touch a user's entry, another agent's, or the
auto-summary. The bulletin is precisely where the rules constraining an agent
live, so an agent that could delete them could delete its own leash — and it
would not need bad intent to do it, only a plausible-sounding tidy-up. The
user's one-click delete on any entry is the other half of the bargain: write
access is safe to grant because it is trivially revocable.

**Where team_id comes from.** The SERVER-SIDE identity of the turn, never a
tool argument. `bus_share_to_team` takes it from the model and validates three
ways; the stronger option exists here because the turn already knows its team.
Naming a different team is therefore not an attack to catch — it is not
expressible. A private turn has no team identity and so no bulletin to write
to, which is why the empty-team case is refused rather than silently scoped to
something.

    "a system message appears when the bulletin updates", and half the writers
    were skipping it.

    NO MENTIONS, deliberately. A mention would wake every member the instant a
    rule is written, and a rule written BY an agent would then wake the agents
    that might write another — the write-wake-write loop. The notice is for the
    humans reading the room; agents pick the rules up on their next turn
    regardless, which is the entire point of the bulletin.
