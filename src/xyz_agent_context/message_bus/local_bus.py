@description: Local SQLite-backed implementation of the MessageBus service

Implements MessageBusService using a DatabaseBackend (typically SQLiteBackend).
Designed for single-node / desktop use. All state lives in the local database.

Key design decisions:
- Cursor-based delivery model via last_processed_at per channel member
- Poison message filtering: messages with >= 3 failures are skipped
- Agent capabilities stored as JSON-serialized list in the registry

    each caller supplies its own `ph`. Sharing an execute() instead would force
    one of them onto the wrong placeholder, which is the bug that made
    `_room_labels` silently return nothing on SQLite.

    It is shared at all because it was copied: the same three-way join lived in
    two files, and "what identifies a DM" is exactly the kind of fact that then
    gets changed in one of them (archived flags, dedupe, cross-owner rules). Four
    copies of the team-room lookup is how `team_rooms.py` came to exist.

    `ORDER BY created_at ASC` is not cosmetic. `send_to_agent` creates a channel
    when the lookup misses, so two concurrent first-sends to the same peer can
    both miss and both create — after which an unordered `rows[0]` is
    engine-dependent, and the sender and the history reader can disagree about
    which channel the conversation is. Ordered, they at least agree on the older

        actually ends the injection, on the deploy rather than on the day someone
        runs the purge.

        arrive as a string OR as an auto-parsed ``datetime`` (db_backend_sqlite
        converts ``*_at`` columns on read). A ``datetime`` serialised via
        ``str()`` becomes ``"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"`` (space, no 'T') while
        ``created_at`` is ``_now_iso()`` ``"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00"`` ('T').
        Since 'T' (0x54) > ' ' (0x20), a space-format cursor makes EVERY newer
        message look unprocessed → the agent is re-triggered forever (capped
        only by the rate limiter). Canonicalise to ISO-8601 so both sides match.

        agent was actually shown what was there. Only the second one gates the
        unread list that rides every turn's context, which is why they cannot be
        merged (``inbox.py`` merged them once and the result was a room that

        Timestamp canonicalisation goes through ``canonical_ts``, which both

        guard because its caller always passes the batch's own high-water mark;
        this one is called from more than one site, and a cursor that can be
        pulled backwards would resurface messages the agent has already read.
