@description: Enumerate a team's shared folder.

The folder has always held files; what it lacked was any way to ask what is
in it. Staging names files by generated id, so the original names live only in
the index — before that existed, discovery was one agent reciting an absolute
path in the room and the others hoping to notice. That made "did you get the
file" a social protocol between models, reliable exactly as often as the
models remembered to narrate.

Kept out of the MCP tool module so the rule that matters — membership, not
ownership — is testable without an MCP transport, and so the same function can
back a route later.
