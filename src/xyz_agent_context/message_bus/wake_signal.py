@description: The cross-process "there is new work" nudge for the poll loop.

`MessageBusTrigger._wake` (2026-08-14) closed the between-turns gap — A posts, B
is mentioned, B waits out the adaptive interval (3-12s) before anyone notices —
but only for posts made by the TRIGGER's own process, because it is an
`asyncio.Event`. Its docstring said so, and named the remedy: "Making it
cross-process means a DB signal and a reader for it".

That remedy stopped being optional when a team reply became a TOOL CALL. The tool
runs on the MCP server, so the room's own relay moved onto exactly the path the
in-process Event never covered; without this module, switching team delivery to a
tool would have handed back part of the latency win measured in `c7739ad1` — and
handed it back as something a person in the room perceives as dead air, which is
what iron rule #16 forbids.

Design notes, in the order they matter:

* **One row, not a queue.** The signal says "look now", never "look at X". The
  poll loop already knows how to find pending work; duplicating that knowledge
  here would give us two answers to one question.
* **Bumped at the write seam.** `LocalMessageBus.send_message` is the only
  `bus_messages` insert in the repository, so putting the bump there makes
  "posted without waking" impossible rather than merely discouraged. That
  retires the structural guard `test_bus_relay_wake` needed while the wake was a
  caller's responsibility.
* **Both dialects, one definition.** Registered in `schema_registry` like every
  other table (iron rule: SQLite and MySQL share the definition), so the desktop
  DMG and the cloud behave identically (iron rule #7).
* **Reads fail OPEN.** An unreadable signal means "no news" and the loop falls
  back to its timer. Raising would take the poll loop down over a latency
  optimisation. The degradation is silent in behaviour but visible in metrics:
  `queue_wait` in the trigger's `[bus-timing]` line is the tier-3 observable
  that catches "the signal stopped working" (iron-rule lesson #4: L1 liveness
  alone is a back door for zombies).
