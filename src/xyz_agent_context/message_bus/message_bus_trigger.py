@description: Background poller that delivers pending messages to agents

Polls bus_messages table, triggers AgentRuntime for agents with
unprocessed messages.

Design:
- Single poller cycles through all registered agents (from bus_agent_registry)
- Groups pending messages by channel_id (per-channel batching)
- For each channel with pending messages, triggers AgentRuntime.run()
- On success: advances the cursor via ack_processed()
- On failure: records failure via record_failure()

Usage:
    DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///path/to/db uv run python -m xyz_agent_context.message_bus.message_bus_trigger

        The id is returned because the errand layer keys its dedup on the
        MESSAGE (see `repository.team_work_repository.has_errand_for`), and the
        only alternative — re-reading the room to find the row just written —
        would race the very poll loop this method just woke.

        The only way THIS PROCESS's own posts should reach the bus — the trigger's
        two of them. It is no longer the only post path in the system: a team
        reply is a `message_team` tool call that goes through
        `team_posting.post_team_reply` -> `bus.send_message` from the MCP server,
        and that is correct rather than an oversight. What replaced this method's
        guarantee for that path is `wake_signal`, bumped inside `send_message`
        itself, i.e. at the write seam where it cannot be skipped.

        Still worth keeping for the two local callers, and not because posting
        needs abstracting — the call is one line — but because "post" and "wake"
        must not be separable. They were, and the second of two call sites was
        already missing the wake: the leader patrol posts under the room's own
        marker and @-mentions members, so a patrolled teammate became pending
        and then waited out a full adaptive interval to be noticed. Platform-
        initiated dead air, which reads worse than an agent being slow.

        A third caller cannot repeat that mistake without going out of its way.

        The wake fires only after `send_message` RETURNS: a post that threw put
        nothing in the room, so there is nothing new to look at
        (`test_a_failed_room_post_does_not_wake`). Exceptions propagate — the
        team-reply site has its own handler for the "reply exists, room will
        never show it" case, and the patrol site is content to let a failure
        surface.

        Two callers: the team-room failure notice and the leader patrol line. The
        team reply was a third while the trigger posted it (`_deliver_reply`);
        that method is gone and the reply arrives via the tool now.

        The notice's wake finds nothing to dispatch — a platform line mentions
        nobody — so it costs one indexed query and is left in rather than
        special-cased, because "post and wake are inseparable" is worth more
        than one avoided empty cycle.

        `liveness_snapshot()` has reported `running` / `waiting` / `max_workers`
        since the 2026-07-27 wedge, and its docstring already names the pattern:
        sustained `running == max_workers` with `waiting > 0` means turns are
        queued behind slots rather than behind their own work. Until now nobody
        read it — the numbers went into a heartbeat row and stopped there.

        This matters for latency specifically: slot wait sits INSIDE
        the `queue_wait_s` the `[bus-timing]` line reports, which is what PRD
        acceptance #1 is judged on. Without this signal a starved pool is
        indistinguishable from
        "everyone's turns got slower".

        Three deliberate properties:

        * **A duration, not an instant.** One saturated moment is a pool being
          used; `STARVATION_ALERT_AFTER_S` of it is a shortage. Measured in
          wall clock rather than cycles because cycles get rarer during
          starvation — see the constant.
        * **Once per episode.** A pool saturated for an hour is one problem, not
          sixty rows. An alarm that fires every cycle becomes noise nobody
          reads (lesson #3).
        * **Diagnostic only.** Nothing here cancels, force-stops or reprioritises
          anything — a multi-hour turn is a legitimate workload (binding rule
          #14). And it does NOT reach the owner's inbox: a slot shortage is a
          platform problem the owner cannot act on, and putting it there would

        A team room delivers by RENDERING: `_build_team_prompt` puts the room's
        recent scrollback into the turn's user message, so what the agent has
        been shown is exactly that window. That is what "read" means here, and
        it holds whether the agent replied or stayed silent — silence is a
        reply-discipline decision, not a claim that it did not look.

        `rendered_from` is the oldest message the prompt actually carried. The
        cursor may only pass it when the window reaches back to wherever the
        cursor already was — otherwise there is a GAP of messages this turn
        never showed, and a single high-water cursor cannot say "read the window
        but not the gap below it". It would swallow them.

        That gap is reachable and not rare: a member nobody @mentions for a
        while accumulates a backlog, and the day it finally gets @mentioned the
        prompt still only carries `TEAM_HISTORY_LIMIT` messages. Advancing to
        the trigger would mark the rest read having never rendered them — the
        same silent loss this method refuses to cause at the un-mentioned and
        rate-limited ack sites, arriving through the one path that does run a
        turn.

        So on a gap the cursor simply does not move. The room stays behind and
        keeps surfacing through the unread list, which is where an un-caught-up
        member is supposed to see it. Rooms whose backlog fits the window — the
        ordinary case — still converge in one turn.

        Nothing else advanced this cursor. Its only other writer keys off a bus
        delivery tool showing up in the turn's trace, and a team reply is posted
        by this trigger — server-side, no tool call — so the cursor sat at
        `joined_at` for the life of the agent while every team message stayed
        unread and rode into EVERY scenario's context, owner chat included.

        Deliberately NOT called from the two ack sites in `_process_lane`
        (un-mentioned, rate-limited). Those advance `last_processed_at` without
        running a turn, so nothing was rendered and nothing was seen. Marking
        them read would drop the messages unseen — and would take with them the
        only way a member nobody @mentioned ever learns what its room is doing,
        which is a capability, not an oversight.

        Team rooms only. In a DM the unread list IS the queue: "I will get to
        it" depends on the message resurfacing, so only an actual reply clears
        it and that path runs through the module hook.

        Best-effort — a cursor that fails to advance costs some duplicate
        context next turn; raising here would cost the turn itself.

        """Is this batch an ANSWER to an errand of ours, or a QUESTION to us?

        Decided from a fact recorded on the message itself
        (``bus_messages.sender_turn_source``): the sender writes WHICH KIND of
        turn produced it — an owner-facing turn ("chat"/"job"/…) or an
        errand-continuation bus turn (``BUS_ERRAND_TURN_SOURCE``) means it is
        running an errand and asking us; plain "message_bus" means it was in
        a peer-ANSWERING turn.

        Plain "message_bus" alone is NOT sufficient for Owner Relay, because
        the stamp records the sender's turn kind, not this message's intent:
        an agent in a peer-answering turn can still ASK (fan out to a third
        agent to compose its answer). So the batch only reads as a reply if
        WE actually hold an errand in this channel — at least one prior send
        of ours stamped with a non-"message_bus" source (or a pre-stamp
        legacy NULL, which gets the old benefit of the doubt). An agent that
        never asked anything here cannot be owed an answer.

        The errand stamp is per-SEND, not per-turn, and that is load-bearing
        here: a bus turn also answers unrelated peers whose unread the platform
        injected from other channels, so only sends aimed at the sender's own
        errand scope carry it (``_send_turn_source`` in the bus module's MCP
        tools). Stamping the whole turn broke exactly this method's contract
        from the other side — an ANSWER to an unrelated peer arrived stamped as
        a question, so that peer stopped relaying to its own owner
        (2026-08-03 review).

        Residual holes, accepted and documented — do not read this list as
        "risk exhausted", read it as what is known:

        1. Stale errand: if we once ran an errand in this channel and a peer
           LATER asks us a fresh question from a peer-ANSWERING turn (a case
           no prompt of ours guides), the old errand rows still vote Owner
           Relay. Per-message intent would need the sender to declare
           ask-vs-answer per send; a turn-kind stamp cannot express it. Equals
           the pre-fix behaviour.
        2. Mutual live errands in one DM channel: DM channels are reused
           symmetrically, so if the errand peer ALSO asked us something and we
           answer them inside our errand-continuation turn, that answer is
           aimed at the errand scope and carries the errand stamp — they then
           answer the peer instead of relaying to their own owner. Needs both
           owners to have errands in flight at the same time toward each
           other. This is the direction we chose: the alternative (stamping
           the whole turn) broke the case the platform ITSELF guides — unread
           from other channels is injected every turn and the prompt requires
           answering it — so it fired far more often.
        3. Group errand channel: the errand scope matches by channel as well
           as by peer, so a send into a GROUP channel that is the errand
           channel stamps every member's copy as a question. Bus errands run
           over auto-created DM channels, so this needs a hand-built group
           channel used as an errand channel.
        4. Uppercase / hand-written stamps: the errand-row check compares the
           stored value exactly (SQL ``<>``), so a row written outside our
           writers with a different casing counts as an errand row → Owner
           Relay. Same direction as every other degradation here.

        Closing 1 and 2 for good needs per-message intent — the sender saying
        "this one is a question" on each send — which the review floated and
        which we did not take, because it puts a correctness-critical bit back
        on model obedience (iron rule #15: a machine-knowable fact must not
        depend on which model the user picked). Revisit only with a default
        that is derived, never assumed.

        Why not infer it from channel ordering (the first attempt, twice):
        "have I spoken here" flips as soon as we answer once, so a follow-up
        question re-broke the bug; "who opened the channel" is fixed forever,
        because ``send_to_agent`` finds a DM channel SYMMETRICALLY and REUSES
        it — so once A has DM'd B, every errand B later runs toward A is
        misclassified for BOTH sides, permanently (P1 2026-08-03 review). The
        fact is per-message, so it has to be stored per-message.

        Degradation, in order: unknown source but WE have never spoken here →
        we are plainly the asked party; otherwise → Owner Relay, the
        pre-2026-08-01 behaviour (a wrongly-relayed answer is cosmetic, while
        wrongly suppressing Owner Relay resurrects the silent failure that
        directive exists to prevent).

        Includes all messages in the batch so the agent has full context.

        If `owner_user_id` is known, appends an owner-relay directive telling
        the agent it MUST call notify_owner(user_id=<owner>,
        ...) to surface the peer exchange back into the owner's chat. Without
        this directive, agents treat peer exchanges as self-contained (they
        reply to the peer or stay silent), and the original owner who asked
        "go talk to agent B for me" never hears back — the reply only lands
        in the Inbox. observed as a silent-failure UX issue in production.

        ``i_started_this_exchange`` decides WHICH directive applies, and it
        matters (P1 2026-08-03, verified live 3/3): Owner Relay was appended
        on every DM turn, so an agent receiving a FRESH question from a peer
        was told "your owner originally asked you to contact this peer agent,
        they are waiting in chat" — false, and it made the recipient answer
        the OWNER and treat the errand as discharged. The asking agent
        (which had promised its user a report) was left waiting forever.
        The models were obeying us; the prompt was lying to them.

        - True  → this batch is the REPLY to an errand of ours: relay it to
                  our owner.
        - False → we are the one being ASKED: answer the PEER on the bus.
                  Our owner asked for nothing and is not waiting.

        Decided by ``_incoming_is_reply_to_my_errand`` from a fact recorded
        on the message itself (``sender_turn_source``) — NOT from "have I
        spoken in this channel", which is only the degradation path and is
        wrong for follow-ups (see that method for why, and for the residual
        holes this pair of directives still has).

        Note the directive an OWNER-RELAY turn receives (item 3: "send a
        clarifying question with message_agent") produces a peer send from
        a bus turn, which is why the same verdict also travels to the tools as
        this turn's errand scope — see ``_invoke_runtime``.

        Invoke AgentRuntime.run() for the given agent with the prompt.

        ``include_monologue`` is PATROL'S, and only patrol's. A team REPLY is a
        tool call now (`message_team`), so nothing harvests an agent's plain text
        as a message any more — except the patrol line, which is a different act:
        the platform asks the lead to compose the room's status line and then
        posts it under the ROOM's own marker with `msg_type=patrol`. A tool could
        not do that (a tool posts as the agent, and the line would then count as
        an agent hop and read as the lead chatting).

        NexusPower streams an agent's plain text as AGENT_THINKING with the
        monologue subset set, so without this flag `turn.text` is EMPTY on that
        framework — dropping it would have made patrol silently stop working for
        every nexus_power agent while looking fine on claude_code.

        Returns a ``TurnResult``.

        ``segments_sink`` is NOT a parameter here any more, and the paragraph
        that used to describe it is gone with it: the team lane stopped
        harvesting an agent's plain text when the room became a tool call, so
        there is nothing to accumulate mid-run. `run_collector` still accepts the
        argument for its own callers.

        ``errand_continuation`` is the DM classifier's verdict ("this batch
        answers an errand I started"). When true, this turn's ERRAND SCOPE
        (the peer that answered us + the channel it happened in) rides
        ``trigger_extra_data`` into ``ctx_data.extra_data``, so a bus send
        aimed at that peer can stamp itself ``BUS_ERRAND_TURN_SOURCE`` instead
        of the plain "message_bus" — otherwise a clarifying follow-up sent
        from this turn is indistinguishable from an answer and the RECIPIENT's
        classifier routes it to Owner Relay (P1 recurrence, path A of the
        2026-08-03 review).

        The scope, not a whole-turn flag: bus unread is injected from ALL
        channels every turn and the module prompt requires answering it, so
        this same turn routinely also answers an unrelated peer. Stamping the
        turn marked that answer as a question too, and that peer then stopped
        relaying to ITS owner — the same P1, one seat over (same review). Only
        the send site knows its target, so only the send site can decide; see
        ``_message_bus_mcp_tools._send_turn_source``.

        Returns a :class:`TurnResult` — the collected response text, the
        turn's events-row id (None if the run died before Step 0), whether any
        reply tool actually delivered, and whether the run ended fatal. The
        team branch stamps the id onto the reply it posts back into the room,
        so the transcript can open that turn's event_log; the caller reads
        ``delivered`` to tell a turn that answered its peer through a tool
        apart from one that reached nobody, and ``fatal`` to tell whether
        ``text`` is the agent's words or a failure notice standing in for
        them — a distinction the room's own error surface depends on.

        `on_event_id`, when provided (team branch only), is forwarded to
        `collect_run` so the turn's events-row id gets bound onto the
        activity row for the team UI.

        There is NO plain-text deliverer any more. The room used to be handed
        the turn's plain text by the runtime; it takes a tool call now, so this
        method's only remaining question about a team turn is whether the agent
        posted — which the bus can answer directly.
