@description: Background poller that delivers pending messages to agents

Polls bus_messages table, triggers AgentRuntime for agents with
unprocessed messages.

Design:
- Single poller cycles through all registered agents (from bus_agent_registry)
- Groups pending messages by channel_id (per-channel batching)
- For each channel with pending messages, triggers AgentRuntime.run()
- On success: advances the cursor via ack_processed()
- On failure: records failure via record_failure()

Usage:
    DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///path/to/db uv run python -m xyz_agent_context.message_bus.message_bus_trigger
