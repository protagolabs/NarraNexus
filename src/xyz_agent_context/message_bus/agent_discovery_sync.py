@description: Keep an agent's peer-discovery row true — the single place that
decides what other agents can learn about it.

Why this exists (P1 段02, prod 2026-08-03)
-----------------------------------------
Two agents of the same user both showed "configuration complete" in the UI, yet
an A2A question was answered with "还没配置完成" and the inbox stayed empty. The
data layer, not the prompts, was at fault:

  * ``agents.agent_description`` was written once at creation as
    "A new agent ready for configuration" and never again — no config change,
    skill install or rename touched it;
  * ``bus_agent_registry`` was written from ONE inline block in
    ``MessageBusModule.hook_data_gathering``, snapshotting that placeholder and
    hardcoding ``capabilities=[]``. All 488 rows in prod looked like that;
  * so ``find_agent`` (matching ``capabilities LIKE ? OR description
    LIKE ?``) answered nothing for every query, the agent-profile lookup (since removed)
    reported "ready for configuration" for a configured agent, and the asking
    agent reasonably concluded the peer was not ready and refused to send
    (evt_feb1f6ae). A2A discovery was systemically dead, not flaky.

Two design rules follow from that, and they are the point of this module:

1. **Recompute, never trust a stored summary.** ``capabilities`` is derived
   from facts the platform already owns — installed skills and active module
   classes — so discovery cannot depend on an agent remembering to describe
   itself (iron rule #15) and no scenario is hardcoded (iron rule #4). A
   description the agent wrote about itself is used verbatim; the legacy
   placeholder is treated as "nothing said" and NOT republished.
2. **One seam, called from everywhere.** Creation, name/description edits,
   awareness configuration, skill install/uninstall and the per-turn bus hook
   all call this function. Registration therefore happens when an agent is
   created — not on its first turn, which is what made a configured-but-idle
   agent invisible to its peers.

   "One" is literal, and it took two removals over two review rounds to earn
   that word — the claim was written here before it was true, which is its own
   lesson:

   * the ``bus_register_agent`` MCP tool let an agent rewrite the row with
     ``owner_user_id=""``, and ``search_agents`` filters on that column, so a
     single call dropped the agent out of its own owner's search results until
     the next turn healed it. Deleted; the agent sets its name/description
     through ``update_agent_profile`` and capabilities are never self-declared.
   * ``InstanceFactory._register_agent_in_bus`` hand-rolled the same upsert
     with ``capabilities=json.dumps([])`` and its own copy of the description
     rule — the original defect, in a third file. It now calls this function,
     which also gave bundle/migration import and arena provisioning the sync
     they never had (both left an empty-capability row behind).

   If you are adding a writer: don't. Call this function.

It lives in ``message_bus/`` rather than ``services/`` because
``bus_agent_registry`` is this package's table and this is synchronous policy
called from routes, MCP tools and hooks — ``services/`` is for background
workers (pollers, sync loops, watchers).

Deliberately NOT here: generating a description with an LLM from the agent's
Awareness. That would put a paid, nondeterministic call on the create path and
on every skill install. The description is a stable self-positioning line
(bootstrap writes it, a rename or reconfiguration can update it); capabilities
carry what changes often.
