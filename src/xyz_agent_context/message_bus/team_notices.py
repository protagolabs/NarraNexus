@description: Things the platform did to a team room, said out loud in it.

A team room was doing several things the room never mentioned. Each one is
correct behaviour that looked, from inside the room, like something else:

**The cascade cap.** When agent hops pile up since the last human message, the
platform stops propagating @mentions so two agents cannot loop forever. That
guard is right. It was recorded in a server log — so from the room it read as
"the agent asked a teammate for help and the teammate ignored it". The user
asked for someone to be pulled in, the platform declined, and nobody said so.

**Roster and lead changes.** Who is in the room decides what `@all` reaches and
who can answer; the lead decides who answers when nobody is named and who patrol
wakes. Both changed silently, which also leaves the transcript above the change
reading as though the current roster wrote it.

Every notice here follows the shape `system_stop` established and the bulletin
notice reused, for reasons that are the same each time:

  * `msg_type` marks it, so the frontend renders a centred line rather than a
    bubble with an identity colour;
  * ``content`` carries an English fallback, because the database cannot know
    the reader's language but text-only consumers still read this;
  * **NO MENTIONS.** For the cascade notice this is load-bearing rather than
    tidy: it exists precisely because the chain must stop, so waking anyone
    would restart the loop it was posted to break. For a roster change, adding a
    member should not immediately hand them a turn;
  * registered in `system_messages.PLATFORM_MSG_TYPES`, so it is excluded from
    the summary trigger, from the transcript's speaker rendering, and from the
    agent-hop count — a cap notice that counted as a hop would make the cap
    tighten every time it fired.

Best-effort throughout: the turn that hit the cap has already produced a real
reply, and failing to narrate it must not lose that.
