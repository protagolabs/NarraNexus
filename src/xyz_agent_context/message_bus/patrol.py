@description: Leader patrol — the platform half of "somebody owns this flow".

The team room is a purely @-driven model: every member, the lead included,
only wakes when addressed. So a flow advances only while each hop remembers to
@ the next one, and any hop that forgets, goes quiet, or has its @ stripped by
the cascade cap kills the chain — with, structurally, nobody to notice. This
module is the periodic activation that gives the flow an owner.

What lives here is the part that must NOT be a model's opinion: deciding an
item is stalled, and deciding a team is due for a patrol. The lead's judgement
begins after that, and (owner decision 2026-08-07) is limited to chasing —
never re-assigning, because "idle with unfinished work" is not the same as
"this one is never coming back", and a wrong re-assignment means two agents
working the same deliverable.

    long as the evidence for it.

    """Items whose assignee has gone quiet. Writes ``stalled`` through.

    The evidence is ``bus_agent_activity``, never a model's read of the room
    (iron rule #15). Three shapes count as stalled, and one very deliberately
    does not:

    * assignee is ``idle`` while the item is unfinished — the Dunhuang shape:
      acknowledged, then silence;
    * assignee claims ``running`` but its heartbeat died — a wedged worker;
    * assignee has no activity row at all — never started;
    * **a fresh ``running`` heartbeat is NOT stalled, however long it has been
      going.** A 25-minute turn is work. Chasing it would make the platform
      the interruption source for exactly the long-running run iron rule #14
      protects.

    Unclaimed items are excluded: nobody is late on a task nobody took. That
    needs handing out, which is a different prompt.

    ``executor_agent_id`` — the agent running this sweep — is excluded for a
    different reason: **its activity row is not evidence about its items.**
    That row describes the current turn, and the current turn is the sweep.
    Read before the sweep opens its row it says idle, so the sweeper would
    stall its own items on every single cycle, permanently, and the prompt
    would then instruct the lead to chase itself. Read after, it says running,
    so the sweeper's items could never stall. Neither reading carries any
    information about whether the item is progressing, and a verdict from
    absent evidence is worse than no verdict.

    The cost is real, accepted, and larger than it first looks: a lead stuck on
    its own item is caught by NOBODY. Patrol is one sweep per team run by that
    team's lead (``teams_due_for_patrol`` yields a single
    ``(team_id, lead, channel)`` per team), so there is no other sweep to fall
    back on. This is a known gap, not a covered case — closing it needs a
    second scanner, either another member or a platform-side pass, and this
    change does not add one.

    It is still the better of the two options on offer: the alternative was a
    permanent self-nag with no recovery path at all. And a stale ``stalled``
    does get cleared (below), so the gap is "nobody notices new trouble", not
    "an old verdict hangs forever".

    Recovery is written through too — an assignee that comes back leaves the
    stalled set, so patrol stops chasing someone already working again.
