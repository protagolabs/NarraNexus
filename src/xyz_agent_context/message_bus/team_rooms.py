@description: One answer to "where is this team's room", and one way to open it.

A team room IS a bus group channel whose ``created_by`` is the synthetic
``team_<id>`` marker. That marker is load-bearing: it is a NON-AGENT value, so
``MessageBusTrigger._should_process_message``'s "the channel owner is always
activated" rule can never match a member, and delivery in a team room stays
purely @-mention driven.

The convention had grown four independent implementations — the work-board
tools, the bulletin notifier, the teams route, and (newest) the job origin
resolver. Four copies of a convention is three chances for them to disagree the
day it changes: give a team a second room, or add an ``is_primary`` flag, and
whoever misses a copy ships a feature that resolves to a different room than the
rest of the product. The newest copy had already drifted before it landed, which
is what prompted the consolidation.

Provisioning joined it here for a different reason: agents gained ``create_team``,
and a core-package MCP tool cannot import from ``backend`` without inverting the
layering. Keeping the lookup and the creation in one file also means the marker
is written in exactly one place and read in exactly one place.

## What is NOT folded in here

``backend/routes/teams.py`` resolves rooms for MANY teams in ONE query
(``created_by IN (...)``). It looks like another copy and is not: it answers a
different question, and rewriting it in terms of ``primary_room_of`` would turn
one indexed query into N — the N+1 shape this repository's repository layer
exists to avoid. It shares the CONVENTION, via ``team_room_marker``; it does not
share the code.
