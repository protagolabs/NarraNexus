@description: The message-level half of the work board — a hand-off records
              itself.

The board (#259) could already notice a stalled task and chase it. What it
could not do was FIND OUT about one: its only entrance was `work_add_item`, a
tool the Leader has to remember to call. That put the entire guard on model
obedience, which is the dependency iron rule #15 keeps off correctness-critical
paths — and the founding case walks straight through it. During the Dunhuang
chain nobody called the tool, so the board was empty and patrol had nothing to
sweep.

This module is the entrance the owner specified on 2026-08-07: an errand is a
MESSAGE-level fact recorded automatically (A @ B opens it, B's reply closes
it), layered under the TASK-level work item that tools maintain explicitly.
Both live in `team_work_items`, told apart by `origin`.

Why the two halves are one module
=================================
Opening without closing is strictly worse than nothing. Every "@Bruno 你怎么看"
would land on a board that every member reads each turn, and patrol would chase
it until someone cleaned up by hand. The value of the entrance depends on the
exit existing, so they are written, changed and tested together.

The rule that carries the incident
==================================
**A promise does not close an errand.** "收到，开始处理……完成后交付 @A4" was
the entire final_output of the run that killed the pipeline. Reading it as
delivery would make the board agree with the runtime that the work was done,
which is precisely the blindness this exists to remove. So `is_promise_only`
biases towards leaving the errand open: a false "promise" costs one patrol
line, a false "delivery" costs the whole mechanism on the one message it was
built for.

The classifier is a heuristic and is allowed to be, because nothing
irreversible hangs off it: staying open means patrol asks once (capped by
`may_patrol_speak`), never that a run is stopped (iron rule #14). The prompt
discipline in `_build_team_prompt` reduces how often it is consulted at all;
it does not replace it (iron rule #15 — the prompt is not the guard).

#: something closes it. `PATROL_SPEECH_MAX` is this repository's own precedent
#: for capping a platform-generated volume.
#:
#: The number is also a latency budget, not only a board-length one. Since the
#: team reply moved inside the turn (#291/#302) this book-keeping runs while the
#: runtime waits on the delivery callback, at two indexed queries per target —
#: so an uncapped "@ twelve people" would sit in the agent's turn.
#:
#: A message addressing more people than this is a broadcast, and a broadcast is
#: `@everyone`, which opens nothing at all.

#: How long an unfinished AUTO errand stays on the board.
#:
#: Auto errands have exactly two exits: the assignee delivers, or the lead
#: closes the item by hand — and the second one is the model obedience this
#: whole layer exists to stop depending on. So an errand that will never be
#: delivered is otherwise PERMANENT, and it does not merely sit there: `stalled`
#: counts as ACTIVE, so one stuck row keeps `teams_with_active_work()` returning
#: this team forever, pins patrol to its 180s stalled cadence forever, and burns
#: the speech budget every 30 minutes forever. `patrol.py` documents "empty
#: board = zero runs" as this feature's cost guarantee; without an expiry, one
#: rhetorical "@Bruno 你怎么看" retires that guarantee for the whole team.
#:
#: 24h rather than something tighter because the ceiling has to clear a
#: legitimately long hand-off — iron rule #14 protects runs that last tens of
#: hours, and expiring an errand out from under one that is still working would
#: make the board lie in the other direction.
ERRAND_TTL_HOURS = 24

#: How many errands one sweep may retire.
#:
#: A DIFFERENT quantity from `MAX_HANDOFFS_PER_MESSAGE` — that one bounds how
#: many rows a single message creates, this one bounds how many a single sweep
#: settles. Expiry is bursty (a room busy yesterday comes due all at once) and
#: the sweep now runs inside the bus poll cycle, ahead of every agent's message
#: dispatch, at two queries per row. The remainder is retired on the next cycle
#: a few seconds later — deferred, never dropped.
MAX_EXPIRIES_PER_SWEEP = 100

#: Addressing the room is not handing work to a person: nobody is late on
#: `@everyone`, and opening one item per member would flood the board.
