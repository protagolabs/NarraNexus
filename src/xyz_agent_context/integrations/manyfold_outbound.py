@description: Managed-reply declaration + Manyfold channel-send client.

Lives in integrations/ with the other external-platform clients
(feedback_client, free_tier/wallet_client): it speaks a foreign wire
contract (bearer auth, camelCase DTO), which is platform semantics, not
a generic utility. ``manyfold_runtime_env()`` is additionally the single
parse of the manyfold runtime triple — the notify webhook
(backend/routes/manyfold/sync.py) delegates here so the two outbound
legs can never diverge on env semantics.

Two related facts live here, shared by the channels inventory
(backend/routes/manyfold/sync.py, which EMITS the declaration to the
platform) and the channel modules' outbound wrappers (which ROUTE sends
according to it):

1. Which providers this deployment declares as agent-managed
   (``NEXUS_MANAGED_REPLY_PROVIDERS`` env, comma-separated). The platform
   mapper defaults mirrored channels to managed-ON, so the inventory emits
   an explicit boolean for every row — this env var is the single fact
   source for both the wire field and the outbound routing.
2. The platform's channel-send endpoint (PR #511): hosted channels reply
   through the platform instead of holding provider credentials in the
   sandbox. Same bearer + runtime identity as the notify webhook; the
   request names a room, never a recipient or a credential (target
   binding is platform-enforced — a room with no inbound history is
   refused with 403).

Never raises: outbound failure surfaces as ``False`` exactly like the
direct-send helpers it substitutes (e.g. wechat's ``send_text_once``),
so call sites keep one error surface regardless of route.
