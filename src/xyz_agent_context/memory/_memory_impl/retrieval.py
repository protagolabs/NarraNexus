@description: Vector-free retrieval primitives for the memory system.

Pure, composable functions — no embeddings, no DB. Operate over an already
scope-filtered candidate list of MemoryRecord (per-(agent,scope) memory is
bounded, so ranking in Python is cheap and dialect-agnostic).

The stack (design §6):
  candidates → BM25-lite (ranked fuzzy) | grep (exact/regex)
            → RRF fusion across rankers
            → recency / proof_count / salience boosts
            → token-budget trim

"Semantic" understanding is intentionally NOT here — it moves up to the LLM
reading the top candidates (the recall caller). BM25 + grep cast the net.
