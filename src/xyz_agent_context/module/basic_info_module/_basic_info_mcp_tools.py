@description: MCP server + narrative-awareness tools for BasicInfoModule (Fix #2 P3).

The agent's conversation history (built by ChatModule.hook_data_gathering) is a
single time-sorted timeline merging the current thread (full) with the latest
~30 lines across the user's OTHER threads, each line tagged
`[<time> · <topic> · nar=<narrative_id> · evt=<event_id>]`, plus a separate
"recent background activity" list (each with an evt= id). The system PICKS a
default narrative for the turn, but that pick isn't always right. These four
tools give the agent visibility + agency over it:

  - view_narrative(narrative_id): full info on a thread incl. ALL its chat
    history (the timeline only shows the latest trimmed slice).
  - view_event(event_id): one past turn's full agent-loop / reasoning detail
    (the timeline only carries the message that was sent to the user).
  - switch_narrative(narrative_id): declare that THIS turn belongs to that
    existing thread — the runtime re-attributes this turn's event + memory.
  - create_narrative(title, description): declare THIS turn starts a NEW thread.

switch/create are SIGNALS. The tool validates/creates and returns the target id;
the agent_runtime hook (step_4_persist_results) detects the call and does the
actual re-attribution. The tool process and the runtime are different processes,
so detection-from-the-tool-call is how they communicate (no shared state).
