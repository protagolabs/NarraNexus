@description: Dialect-safe narrative / event read helpers shared by the
AgentDataStore seam (DirectStore) and the backend narrative/event routes
(the HttpStore path).

The BasicInfoModule's view_narrative / view_event / switch_narrative MCP tools
used to hand-write MySQL (``SELECT `trigger` … FROM events``, ``information_
schema``-free but still raw ``%s`` + backtick), which only runs locally via the
sqlite translation shim and is exactly the kind of thing the dual-dialect rule
forbids leaking. These functions reimplement those reads on the
``AsyncDatabaseClient`` helpers (``get_one`` / ``get`` / ``get_by_ids``), which
are dialect-safe on SQLite AND MySQL.

Each ``fetch_*`` / ``check_*`` returns the COMPLETE result dict and never
raises — so the seam's DirectStore and the route can both just ``return await
fetch_x(...)`` and get byte-identical output (parity by a single shared
implementation, not two hand-kept copies). They also add the ``agent_id``
ownership filter the raw-SQL tools lacked: the old tools would return ANY
agent's narrative/event by id (a cross-tenant read); these scope to the caller.
