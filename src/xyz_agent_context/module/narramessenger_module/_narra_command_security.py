@description: Security layer for the generic ``narra_cli`` passthrough MCP tool.

The passthrough hands an arbitrary command string to the local ``narra-cli``
binary. This module keeps that safe with a small, explicit surface (narra-cli
has only ~6 domains):

  - ``ALLOWED_DOMAINS`` whitelist — the first token must be a known narra-cli
    domain.
  - ``BLOCKED_PATTERNS`` — ``configure`` (endpoint is a platform-global concern)
    and ``doctor`` (a probe surface); these are not the agent's to run.
  - ``BLOCKED_FLAGS`` — ``--token`` / ``--token-file`` are INJECTED by
    ``narra_cli_client`` per call; an agent supplying its own would override our
    injection or probe for a readable path, so they are always rejected.
  - ``explore`` is gated to official agents (upstream marks it "Official Agents
    Only").
  - ``shlex.split`` + ``shell=False`` argv is the real injection defense — NOT a
    shell-metachar denylist. A denylist would only break legitimate message
    content ("S&P 500", "$76,000", markdown tables) while adding no safety under
    ``execve`` (the same lesson burned in on the Lark side —
    ``_lark_command_security``).

Mirrors ``lark_module/_lark_command_security.py`` in shape; independent per
binding rule #3 (modules must not import each other).
