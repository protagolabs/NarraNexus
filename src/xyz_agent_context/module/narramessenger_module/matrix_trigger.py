@description: NarraMessenger MatrixTrigger — replaces the polling long-poll
              on the message plane with a real Matrix client (matrix-nio)
              talking to matrix.netmind.chat directly.

Scope of THIS FILE (Phase 1, Commits 3 + 4b + 5 + 6 + 7):
  ✓  Class + ChannelTriggerBase wiring, all abstract methods present
  ✓  ``connect()`` implements the sync loop with the strict cursor-save
     ordering (see :meth:`connect` docstring)
  ✓  ``parse_event()`` handles ``m.room.message`` (text)
  ✓  ``is_echo()`` filters our own agent's messages back out of the
     sync stream
  ✓  Auto-persist ``device_id`` on first sync (matrix-nio populates
     ``client.device_id`` after the server ack)
  ✓  (4b) Room member count + display name caches populated by
     ``m.room.member`` state events flowing through the sync loop
  ✓  (4b) DM / group_mention / group_silent classification, with
     mention detection covering MSC3952 intentional mentions, raw
     MXID inline, and ``@displayname`` inline
  ✓  (4b) Silent-batch buffer + debounce (5s idle OR 20 msgs) → hands
     off to :meth:`ChannelTriggerBase._build_and_run_agent_silent_batch`
     from Commit 4a; drained on reconnect burst AND on ``stop()``
  ✓  (4b) Reply sending via ``client.room_send`` with M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
     retry-after honoring and permanent-auth-failure short-circuit;
     transient failures logged to ``EVENT_TRANSPORT_SEND_FAILED`` audit
  ✓  (4b) ``extract_output()`` reads
     ``send_message_to_user_directly`` tool call args — no more
     accidental agent-thinking spill into the room
  ✓  (4b) Silent-not-reply fix: agent that skips the reply tool sends
     nothing
  ✓  (5)  Narra ``authorize-event`` gate before every event; deny +
     notice forwards ``m.notice`` back to the room, else silent drop
  ✓  (6)  Auto-join invited rooms during the sync loop
     (``autoJoin: always`` per NarraMessenger's OpenClaw config)

  ✓  (Phase 3) Multimodal: ``m.image`` / ``m.file`` / ``m.audio`` /
     ``m.video`` → ``_wrap_event`` marshals the mxc URI, ``parse_event``
     populates ``attachment_refs``, ``fetch_attachments`` downloads via
     the authenticated ``/_matrix/client/v1/media/download`` endpoint and
     hands bytes to the base ``_persist_attachment`` (workspace store +
     MIME sniff + audio STT). The agent reads the file via its Read tool
     at the path the ``Attachment`` marker announces.

Deferred to Phase 4:
  ✗  Progressive update via ``m.replace``
  ✗  Typing indicator via ``PUT /rooms/{room}/typing/{user}``
  ✗  ``NarramessengerContextBuilder`` adapting to matrix event shape
     (currently shared with the polling trigger — good enough for
     text-only Phase 1)

    # NarraMessenger's setup guide requires calling authorize-event
    # BEFORE reading history, writing memory, invoking tools, calling
    # the model, or sending a reply. In practice Narra's policy denies
    # group events with ``mentioned=False`` outright (verified by live
    # E2E on agent_62cf67080ad4: authorize-event returned
    # ``allow=False`` on every non-@ group message).

    # The owner's product intent is different: "if the agent is in the
    # room, it has the right to hear what's said, it just shouldn't
    # reply unless addressed." So we override Narra's decision for the
    # silent-batch memory-write path only:
    #
    #   dm / group_mention  → authorize-event REQUIRED (we'll reply,
    #                          call tools, invoke the model — those
    #                          are exactly what the gate is for)

    #                          invocation — the guide's rationale

          1. First ``AGENT_RESPONSE`` past ``STREAM_MIN_CHARS_BEFORE_PLACEHOLDER``
             → send placeholder via ``room_send``, remember event_id.
          2. Each subsequent ``AGENT_RESPONSE`` delta accumulates; if
             both ``STREAM_EDIT_DEBOUNCE_MS`` AND
             ``STREAM_EDIT_MIN_DELTA_CHARS`` are satisfied → send an edit.
          3. On ``TOOL_CALL`` for ``narra_reply`` → capture the text.
          4. Stream ends → if we have ``narra_reply.text``, final edit
             overwrites the placeholder (or, if no placeholder was ever
             shipped, a fresh send). If no ``narra_reply.text``, redact
             the placeholder — silent-not-reply, per the trigger's
             existing contract.

        AGENT_THINKING is deliberately ignored: users see final answers,
        not the agent's internal reasoning.
