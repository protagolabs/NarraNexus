@description: Entity description and persona update logic.

Extracted from SocialNetworkModule to separate LLM-powered entity update
operations from the module's hook orchestration and MCP interface.

Contains:
- summarize_new_entity_info: LLM conversation summarization
- append_to_entity_description: Cumulative description update with compression
- compress_description: LLM description compression
- update_interaction_stats: Interaction counter increment
- should_update_persona: Persona refresh condition check
- infer_persona: LLM persona inference
- update_entity_persona: Persona DB write
- extract_mentioned_entities: LLM batch extraction
- decide_merge_or_create: LLM dedup decision

2026-05-27: removed `update_entity_embedding` and the dedup
`DEDUP_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` / `DEDUP_TOP_K` constants together with
the semantic-search chain (Owner spec). Mentioned-entity dedup now
relies on Stage 1 (name/alias exact match) + LLM disambiguation only.

2026-08-24 — failures here stop being silent. Every function below used
to catch, log, and return an empty-ish value, which the caller could not
tell apart from a legitimately empty RESULT: `summarize_new_entity_info`
returning "" meant either "the LLM found nothing worth remembering" or
"the LLM is dead", and the caller skipped the write either way. So a
broken helper-LLM key degraded long memory with no owner-facing signal
at all — and "this sender's profile is permanently blank" is exactly why
the agent in the 8/14 ping-pong incident could not notice it had met
this peer 60,000 times before.

Two fixes, applied to all eight handlers:
  - Failure is now DISTINGUISHABLE from emptiness. The two functions
    whose empty value was ambiguous return `None` on failure (binding
    rule #2 — the signature just changes, no compatibility shim).
  - Failure is now REPORTED. LLM call sites route to
    `alert_background_llm_failure` (whose docstring already listed
    `entity_summary` as an intended source — the hole was dug, never
    wired); DB write sites leave a `service_audit` error row, since a
    failed UPDATE is not something an owner can fix by rotating a key.

    Ownership is resolved through ``AgentRepository.resolve_owner`` — the
    ONE answer to "who owns this agent". A hand-rolled
    ``get_one("agents", ...)`` here (the first version of this function)
    would be the fourth private copy of that lookup, which is exactly the
    drift PR #258 collapsed; ``backend/routes/channels/wechat.py`` carries
    an explicit prohibition against it.

    ``resolve_owner`` distinguishes ``""`` (unknown agent) from ``None``
    (the lookup itself failed) and both are falsy, so the alert's
    "notify only when the owner is known" behaviour is unchanged — do not
    collapse them with ``or ""``.

    Best-effort throughout: an observer must never break the observed.
    ``alert_background_llm_failure`` never raises on its own, but the DB
    handle for the owner lookup can, so that call stays wrapped. The audit

    ``agent_id`` is optional here, unlike the required ``agent_id`` on the
