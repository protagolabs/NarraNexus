        IMMEDIATELY call this when someone introduces themselves or shares personal/professional information.

        Extract and persistently store information about users, agents, or organizations.
        This is how you build and maintain your social network memory with structured tags and identity data.

        **When to call (DO NOT WAIT)**:
        - User introduces themselves (name, role, company, expertise)
        - Someone mentions another person/agent/organization
        - Contact info is shared (email, phone, website)
        - Any biographical or professional detail appears

        **Tagging Discipline (IMPORTANT)**:
        - Tags are expensive — only add tags that carry clear, lasting signal
        - Aim for 2-3 tags per entity. Most updates need ZERO new tags
        - Before adding a tag, consider if the entity already has a similar one
        - Use canonical forms consistently (e.g. "expert:recommendation_system", not "expert:recommender_systems")
        - One expertise level per domain, one stage tag at a time

        Args:
            agent_id: The ID of the agent who owns this social network
            entity_id: The user_id or agent_id of the person
            updates: Information to update (entity_name, identity_info, contact_info, tags)
                 DO NOT include entity_description - it's auto-managed by conversation summaries
            update_mode: How to update: 'merge' combines with existing info, 'replace' overwrites (default: 'merge')

        Returns:
            Operation result with success status and message

        Example 1 - User introduces themselves with clear expertise:
            User: "你好，我是Alice，我是推荐系统专家"

            extract_entity_info(
                agent_id="your_agent_id",
                entity_id="user_alice_123",

                    "entity_name": "Alice",
                    "tags": ["expert:recommendation_system"]
                }
            )

        Example 2 - User shares role and company (store in identity_info, minimal tags):
            User: "我叫Bob，在Acme Corp做前端开发"

            extract_entity_info(
                agent_id="your_agent_id",

                    "entity_name": "Bob",
                    "identity_info": {
                        "organization": "Acme Corp",
                        "position": "前端工程师"

                    "tags": ["engineer"]
                }
            )

        Example 3 - Adding contact info (use channels structure for IM channels):
            User: "我的邮箱是 alice@example.com, 飞书 open_id 是 ou_alice_open_id"

        Search your social network for people. Supports exact ID lookup,
        keyword fuzzy match (over name / description / tags / aliases),
        and explicit tag-only search.

        Note (2026-05-27): semantic / embedding-based search was removed.
        Phrase your query as keywords found in the person's name,
        description, tags, or aliases — natural-language questions like
        "who showed purchase intent?" will not match anything that does
        not literally contain those words.

                - 'auto': Detects an entity_id (prefix `user_`,
                  `entity_`, or `agent_`) and routes to exact_id;
                  otherwise falls back to keyword.
                - 'exact_id': Force exact entity_id lookup.
                - 'tags': Match against tags only.
                - 'keyword': LIKE-substring match on
                  name / description / tags / aliases (same path
                  `auto` falls through to).
