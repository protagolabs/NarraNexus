# Delivery instructions — one per surface this job can report back to.

# Split out of the template above on 2026-08-14. It used to hard-code the
# owner's private chat, which is how "@Leader remind us tomorrow", asked in a
# team room in front of four people, delivered into one person's DM and the
# room that asked never heard back.
#
# The prompt and the delivery code must agree, so both are selected from the
# SAME recorded origin (`jobs.origin_source`) — see `job_delivery_instructions`
# and `job_trigger._deliver_to_origin`. Naming the wrong tool sends the report
# to the wrong audience: the owner's private chat instead of the room that
# asked, or the reverse.
#
# 2026-08-17: the room variant used to say the reply auto-posts and no function
# was needed. That was true for exactly as long as the team room accepted plain
# text — the one surface in the platform where "plain text reaches nobody" was
# false. It is a tool call now like every other surface, so an unchanged room
# prompt would have told a job to write its report and stop, and the room would
# have received nothing at all.

## Job Information

**Job ID**: {job_id}
**Title**: {title}
**Description**: {description}
**Payload**: {payload_preview}...

**End Condition**: {end_condition}

**Current Iteration**: {iteration_count}
**Max Iterations**: {max_iterations}

## Current Chat Interaction

**User Query**: {user_query}

**Agent Response**: {chat_content_preview}...

## Your Task

Determine if this chat interaction indicates that the job's end condition has been met.

For example, if the end condition is "customer shows purchase intent or explicit rejection":
- Customer says "I'll buy it" -> end condition MET
- Customer says "No thanks, I don't need it" -> end condition MET
- Customer asks "What's the price?" -> end condition NOT MET (still interested, continuing conversation)

## Return Fields

1. **job_id**: "{job_id}"

2. **is_end_condition_met**: true/false - Does this interaction satisfy the end condition?

3. **end_condition_reason**: Detailed explanation of why the condition is/isn't met

4. **should_continue**: true/false - Should the job continue?
   - false if end_condition is met
   - false if max_iterations reached (current: {iteration_count}, max: {max_iterations})
   - true otherwise

5. **progress_summary**: 1-2 sentence summary of what happened in this interaction

6. **process**: 2-3 concise descriptions of actions taken
