@description: Job WRITE helpers shared by the AgentDataStore seam (DirectStore),
the seam twin route, and the frontend job routes.

``update_job_from_args`` is the ~90-line job_update body (validate job_type /
trigger_config / next_run_time / status, build the ``updates`` dict, then
``JobInstanceService.update_job``) lifted into ONE place. It existed as three
drifting copies — the MCP tool, the ``/api/jobs/{job_id}`` frontend route, and
(after this migration) the agent-scoped seam route — and the ``effective_type``
/ ``compute_next_run`` ordering here is the load-bearing zombie-bug fix
(pre-open review #4): a one_off→scheduled switch with a new cron must compute
next_run against the NEW type, or the job silently never runs again. Keeping one
copy is the only safe way to not re-open that bug in one path.

Dialect-safe (JobRepository / JobInstanceService, no raw SQL). Returns the
COMPLETE result dict and never raises. Agent-scoped: a job owned by a different
agent reads as "not found" (no existence oracle — matches the route's posture,
which is SAFER than the old tool's "does not belong to agent X").

    A job's owner has a ground truth, and the supplied value often is not it.
    On a bus turn ``user_id`` is the SENDER (``message_bus_trigger`` passes
    ``sender_agent_id``), so a job asked for in a team room arrived here as
    ``usr_<uid>`` or a peer's ``agent_id`` — an owner that does not exist. The
    job was then filed under it: the owner's Jobs list stayed empty, and
    execution loaded a context belonging to nobody, while the agent reported
    success.

    Fixed HERE rather than in ``_mcp_identity.resolve_caller_user_id``, which
    overrides placeholders only and documents why a mismatching REAL value can
    be legitimate on the generic path. That judgement is about identity in
    general; "whose job is this" is a narrower question with an answer in the
    database, so it is answered where the row is written — one site, covering
    the local MCP process and the cloud seam route alike.

    Fails open. ``resolve_owner`` returns "" for "no such agent" and None for
    "the query failed"; neither is evidence the caller was wrong, and blanking
    the field would lose the job outright. Divergences are logged rather than
    silently corrected — that log line is the measurement the generic path's
    comment asks for before anyone widens this.

    ``related_entity_id`` is untouched: it answers "about whom", which is a
    different question and a supported shape.
