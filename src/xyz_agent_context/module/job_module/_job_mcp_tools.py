@description: JobModule MCP Server tool definitions

Separates MCP tool registration logic from the JobModule main class,
keeping JobModule focused on Hook and core business logic.

Tools:
- job_create: Create a background job
- job_retrieval_semantic: Semantic search for jobs
- job_retrieval_by_id: Query job by ID
- job_retrieval_by_keywords: Keyword search for jobs
- job_update: Update job properties
- job_pause: Pause a job
- job_cancel: Cancel a job

    a protocol change and every reader — while a team room is deterministically
    the group channel whose ``created_by`` is the ``team_<id>`` marker, so the
    fact is already on the wire.

    Peer DMs are deliberately NOT an origin: an agent-to-agent channel has no
    human reader, so a report delivered there is a report nobody sees.

    Fails to ``(None, None)`` — a job that reports to the owner is the old
