@description: The ONE header-level identity verification, shared by every
consumer of the nx-agent bearer contract.

Both verifiers — the mcp middleware (identity/mcp_auth.py) and backend's
nx-agent service path (backend/auth.py) — run the identical algorithm: take
the explicit X-NarraNexus-Identity-Token header or the bearer's identity_token
field (last in BEARER_FIELDS — #9 since #255 took #7/#8), verify
the Ed25519 signature, and cross-check the self-declared bearer user_id
against the proven sub. Only their DEGRADATION differs (mcp fails open on a
missing key, backend fails closed), so that stays with the callers and the
algorithm lives here once — a third copy was already on the horizon
(broker/executor-side consumers) and near-identical copies drift.
