@description: The single writer for the bootstrap greeting chat row.

The greeting is persisted by TWO callers — ChatModule.hook_persist_turn (the
lazy prepend on a turn whose history is still empty) and the step_1
provision-time seed (driven by bootstrap/greeting_seed) — so the row's shape
and its timestamp constraints live HERE, in the chat module that owns the
`instance_json_format_memory_chat` table, instead of being copied into
bootstrap/ where the two would drift apart.

Load-bearing constraints, in one place:
  - meta_data.bootstrap = True marks the row for the frontend / auto-delete.
  - The timestamp is anchored to turn-START (event.created_at) minus 1ms, NOT
    to `utc_now()` and NOT to the agent's creation time:
      * turn-start - 1ms sorts strictly before the user's first message (stamped
        turn-start), so a timestamp-ascending render (chat-history API +
        frontend timeline) keeps the greeting on top.
      * turn-start ≈ when the user pressed enter, so it satisfies the TIME half
        of the frontend's session-copy dedup — buildTimeline.ts dedups a
        no-event_id session message against history by (role, content) AND a
        5-minute window; anchoring further back (e.g. agent creation) would blow
        the window. NOTE the window is only one half: dedup also needs the
        content to MATCH, and the seeded row's content is the English
        `bootstrap_greeting` metadata while the frontend session copy is the
        localized text — so in a non-English UI the copy is NOT deduped and the
        greeting renders twice. That is a pre-existing limitation (the lazy hook
        wrote the same English content), tracked for a separate fix (give the
        bootstrap row a stable identity the frontend can dedup on instead of
        content); this anchor does not claim to close it.
  - The datetime is normalised to aware-UTC before isoformat(), so the emitted
    string carries a `+00:00`/`Z` offset and the browser's `new Date()` parses
    it as UTC rather than local time (the naive-datetime-on-MySQL trap).
