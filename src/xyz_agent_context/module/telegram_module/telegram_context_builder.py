@description: Build execution context for Telegram-triggered messages.

Inherits ChannelContextBuilderBase. Unlike Slack/Lark, Telegram's Bot
API does NOT expose a server-side history endpoint (bots can only see
events they themselves received). To avoid agents replying with zero
context — observed 2026-05-13 where the agent treated "再试一下" as
"retry the Telegram channel test" instead of "retry the weather query"
because no recent turns were in the prompt — we fall back to the local
local inbox record, which ``InboxRecorder`` populates for both inbound user
messages and outbound bot replies under
``thread_id = im_thread_id("telegram", agent_id, chat_id)``.

Note this is one of the two places the inbox record is also OPERATIONAL: for a
channel with no history API it IS the agent's conversation memory, not just
something a person reads. The 2026-08-17 decoupling moved this reader with the
writer — leaving it on ``bus_messages`` would have made Telegram forget every
conversation.
