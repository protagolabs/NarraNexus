@description: Consolidated supervisor for ALL IM channel triggers.

Replaces the old "one OS process per channel" layout (six near-identical
``run_<channel>_trigger.py`` entrypoints). Every ``ChannelTriggerBase`` subclass
now runs inside THIS single process, sharing one Python interpreter, one import
of the package, and one per-loop database pool.

Why consolidate
===============
- Memory: the heavy package import graph (agent_runtime -> agent_framework ->
  all modules -> narrative -> ...) was resident SIX times. Now once.
- SQLite: six processes each opened the same SQLite file, multiplying lock
  contention. One process = one opener.
- Maintenance: the six-process fact was hard-coded across run.sh, dev-local.sh,
  deploy-cloud.sh, and the Tauri desktop factories. One entrypoint collapses it.

``ChannelTriggerBase.start()`` is non-blocking (it spawns the credential watcher
+ workers as asyncio tasks and returns), and every trigger keeps its state on
the instance with no shared mutable globals — so N triggers coexist in one event
loop, each driving its own subscribers/workers independently. A crash in one
channel's task is contained by the base's per-task try/except; the supervisor
additionally isolates STARTUP failures (one channel failing to start never
aborts the others).

Usage
=====
    # all channels (default)
    python -m xyz_agent_context.module.run_channel_triggers

    # a subset — lets cloud split a high-volume channel into its own
    # container without any code change
    python -m xyz_agent_context.module.run_channel_triggers --only lark,slack

Out of scope: JobTrigger and MessageBusTrigger are NOT channel triggers (they do
not subclass ChannelTriggerBase) and keep their own processes.
