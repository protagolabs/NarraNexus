@description: Register the `register_artifact` MCP tool on the common_tools_module
FastMCP server. The call resolves the per-agent context from the MCP request
headers, opens a fresh DB client, and delegates to ArtifactService.

Pointer model (2026-05-14): the agent writes artifact files into its own
workspace, then calls `register_artifact` with the entry file path. The tool
registers a pointer — it never copies, moves, or writes content.

        The LLM-facing contract lives in the `description=` above. This body
        resolves a DB client, decides the artifact's OWNING SCOPE, and
        delegates to `ArtifactService.register`; all validation and path logic
        is there. Every failure path returns a structured `{error, code}` dict.

        Scope resolution — the team comes from the SERVER, the model only gets
        a veto:

          * the turn's team is read from the identity headers, so a model
            cannot place an artifact into a team by naming one (`agent_id` is
            already a model-filled parameter — trusting arguments here would
            let a private chat write into a team's workspace);
          * `scope="private"` is the one lever the model has, and it can only
            NARROW: it opts a draft out of the team it is actually in;
          * anything else, including the default and any value the model
            invents, follows the turn. Defaulting to the turn is what makes
            this safe under a weak model: the common case needs no decision at
            all, and an unrecognised value degrades to the correct behaviour
            rather than to a private artifact nobody can find.

        `scope` is a plain `str` with a default rather than `Optional[str]`:
        FastMCP renders Optional as `anyOf:[X,null]`, which strict-schema
        providers reject with a request-level 400 — the whole request fails,
        not just this call.
