@description: Register `resolve_relative_date` and `compare_dates` on the
common_tools_module FastMCP server — deterministic calendar arithmetic, so
the model never has to do it in its head.

Why these exist
---------------
Every agent handles time, and every agent was doing the arithmetic by
reasoning. Three failure modes were observed, all of them silent:

  1. Relative expressions resolve to the wrong date. A user said "下周五" on
     a Thursday; the agent recorded the correct timestamp but named the
     wrong day when it came back to it.
  2. A stored absolute date is compared against "now" incorrectly, so a date
     that has already passed is still described as upcoming.
  3. Both get worse across a timezone boundary, where "today" itself differs
     by one depending on which clock you read.

Getting a date wrong is not a cosmetic error — a user who is told the wrong
day stops trusting every other date the agent gives them.

The division of labour
----------------------
These tools deliberately do NOT parse natural language. Language
understanding is the one part of this the model is genuinely good at, and a
parser would be a second, worse interpreter of it — locale-dependent,
silently wrong on the phrasings it did not anticipate, and impossible to
test against real usage.

So the model decomposes the phrase ("下周五" → the Friday of the week after
this one) and the tool does the arithmetic. Each half does what it is
reliable at, and the tool's contract is total: for any (unit, offset,
weekday, reference) it returns exactly one date, with no ambiguity left.

Ambiguity is surfaced, not resolved
-----------------------------------
"next Friday" means different things to different people (and 下周五 does
not mean the same as "this coming Friday"). The tool cannot know which was
meant, so it does not guess: it applies one documented rule — ISO weeks,
Monday-start — and returns `week_start` / `week_end` alongside the answer so
the agent can show the user which week it landed on. A wrong date the user
can see is wrong is recoverable; a wrong date presented bare is not.

    Accepts `YYYY-MM-DD`, full ISO timestamps (with or without offset /

    renders for agents to read**:

        2026-07-31 00:30 +08:00                              (timeline rows)
        2026-08-08 09:00:00 +08:00 (Tuesday, Asia/Shanghai)  (ground-truth now)

    That last one is why the annotation strip exists. The prompts tell the
    agent to pass a date it saw — "pass that message's date as `reference`",
    "confirm with compare_dates" — and the single most likely thing for a
    model to pass is a token it can literally see. If the parser rejects the
    platform's own rendering, the tool answers `bad_reference` / `bad_date`,
    and by this file's own argument the model then goes back to doing the
    arithmetic itself: the exact step these tools exist to remove. The
    failure would also be invisible — a structured error in a tool result,
    nothing in the audit trail, and a user who just sees a wrong date again.

    (The space between time and offset parses natively: this project requires
    Python >= 3.13, whose `fromisoformat` accepts it. Only the parenthesised
    tail needs removing.)

    A timestamp that carries a frame is converted into the user's before its
    date is taken — dropping that would reintroduce the off-by-one this whole
    change set is about, so the strip is deliberately narrow: it removes the
