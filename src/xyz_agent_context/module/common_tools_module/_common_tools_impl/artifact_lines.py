@description: Shared per-artifact line rendering for the agent-facing
inventory surfaces.

The state block (every turn) and the list_artifacts tool (on demand) must
show identical lines — same id/kind/title, same path rules — or the agent
has to learn two dialects for one inventory. This module is the single
owner of that formatting; both callers import it.

Path rules (moved verbatim from the state block, 2026-08-18):
- An entry inside the agent's OWN workspace renders as a short relative
  path — the form its file tools take.
- Anything else (a teammate's team artifact, an entry in the team shared
  folder) renders ABSOLUTE: a bare base-relative path would resolve
  against the READER's workspace (the confinement layer rebases relative
  paths there deliberately) and point at a file that does not exist.
- URL tabs point the agent at the readable text snapshot (content.md)
  when it exists on disk, so the agent can SEE the page content.
