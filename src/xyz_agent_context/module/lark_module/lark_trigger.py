@description: Lark event trigger — listens for incoming messages via
lark-oapi SDK WebSocket long connection.

Architecture: 1 WebSocket thread per bound bot + N shared async workers.
When a colleague sends a message to the bot, the trigger:
1. SDK callback puts event into async task_queue
2. Worker picks up event, builds context via LarkContextBuilder
3. Runs AgentRuntime
4. Writes result to Inbox

        Three layers, cheapest-first:

          1. Startup-time filter (O(1), no I/O) — Lark events whose
             `create_time` is older than ``startup_time - HISTORY_BUFFER_MS``
             are replays from before this process started. Drop without
             any further check. This alone kills most of the restart-
             induced duplication because Lark re-delivers many minutes-
             to-hours-old events on reconnect.

          2. In-memory hot cache (O(1) with lock) — dedup within the
             current process lifetime. TTL-bounded so the dict doesn't
             grow without bound.

          3. Durable DB gate (one round-trip, atomic) — via
             ``LarkSeenMessageRepository.mark_seen``. Survives process
             restarts: a message recorded in a prior process lifetime
             will still be flagged as "seen". The unique constraint on
             ``message_id`` makes this atomic under concurrent workers.

        Fail-open on I/O error (return True) so that a transient DB
        issue doesn't silence the bot — double-processing is annoying
        but silent loss is worse.
