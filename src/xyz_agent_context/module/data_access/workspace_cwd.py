@description: Shared subprocess-CWD resolution for channel CLI passthroughs.

lark-cli / narra-cli write default-relative outputs (downloads, artifacts)
to their CWD, so the subprocess must be spawned inside the agent's own
workspace or those files land outside the agent's Read sandbox (the
2026-05-28 "transcript downloaded to a path I can't read" P0). The owner
lookup goes through the channel seam so it behaves identically in
direct-db and zero-cred deployments. One shared implementation + one
owner cache — this used to be a per-channel copy in each CLI client, and
the copies drifted.

It lives in data_access (not utils/) because it NEEDS the seam: putting
it lower would give utils/ its first upward edge into module/, and would
also move it out of the pyright gate's include scope.
