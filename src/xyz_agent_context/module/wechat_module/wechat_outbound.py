@description: Single decision point for WeChat outbound routing.

Every WeChat send site — the ``wechat_send`` MCP tool, the module's
``send_to_agent`` (ChannelSenderRegistry: step_3 DM fallback +
``contact_agent``), and the trigger's ``send_channel_reply`` (managed
error fallback) — calls ``send_wechat_text`` instead of ``send_text_once``
directly. The router decides per call:

- provider declared managed AND manyfold runtime env resolves →
  ``POST channel-send`` on the platform. No ``context_token`` needed:
  the platform resolves the recipient from ``room_id`` (= the WeChat peer
  id) and holds the iLink credential itself.
- otherwise → the legacy direct iLink path, byte-identical to before.

A failed platform send is returned as ``False`` and deliberately NOT
retried via direct iLink: managed mode means the platform owns delivery,
and a sandbox-side direct send would race the platform's own retry into a
double message.

One wrapper rather than a flag inside ``send_text_once`` because the SDK
client layer is transport-only and must not learn manyfold semantics;
routing is a module-layer concern.

    message); ``unavailable`` → the platform never received a delivery
