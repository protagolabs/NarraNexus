@description: The agent-facing memory tools — `remember`, `grep_memory`,
`memory_retain`.

These are the unified "回忆" surface (design §6.3): one cross-kind ranked
recall + one cross-kind exact/regex search + one explicit durable write,
replacing the fragmented per-module recall tools (view_narrative /
search_social_network / get_chat_history / …). All three (`remember`,
`grep_memory`, `memory_retain`) route through the AgentDataStore seam
(DirectStore locally / HttpStore in cloud — see module/data_access), so the
cloud mcp container needs no db credentials. grep's regex path is now safe on
the shared API: retrieval.grep_filter runs the untrusted pattern through the
`regex` package with a per-match timeout + total budget (was the last blocker —
its HTTP twin used to refuse regex).
`agent_id` is a tool parameter (the LLM passes its own id — same convention as
every other module's tools).
