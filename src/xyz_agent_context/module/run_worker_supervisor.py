@description: Consolidated supervisor for ALL long-running background workers.

Replaces the old "one OS process per worker" layout (module_poller,
job_trigger, message_bus_trigger, run_channel_triggers as four separate
``python -m ...`` processes) with ONE process running every worker inside a
single asyncio event loop, sharing one Python interpreter, one import of the
heavy package graph, and one per-loop database pool.

Why consolidate
===============
- Memory: ``import xyz_agent_context`` costs ~128 MB resident per process; four
  worker processes paid that four times over. Now once. (MCP stays a separate
  process on purpose — it is a port-bound SSE server, a different kind of thing,
  and already single-process via ``run_mcp_servers_async``.)
- SQLite: four processes each opened the same file, multiplying lock contention.
  One process = one opener (the same win ``run_channel_triggers`` already banked
  for the six IM-channel processes).
- Maintenance: the four-process fact was hard-coded across run.sh, dev-local.sh,
  .dev-local-safe.sh, deploy-cloud.sh, and the Tauri desktop factories.

This is the same collapse ``run_channel_triggers`` did for channels, one layer
up: that file's ``main()`` is the direct template for the shutdown machinery
here (own-signal handling, close_db_client, loguru drain). The channels group is
itself supervised as ONE of the workers here (via ``start_channel_triggers``),
so there is a single supervisor, not a supervisor-of-supervisors.

Supervision model
=================
Each worker runs as a supervised asyncio task with **per-task exponential
backoff restart** (binding rule / incident lesson #2: no naked fire-and-forget —
every wrapper is awaited via ``asyncio.gather``). A worker task that RAISES is a
crash → audited + backed off + restarted; a task cancelled during shutdown is
NOT restarted. There is deliberately **no** cap on how long a worker may run
without returning: a worker blocked for hours is HEALTHY, not a hang (binding
rule #14). The only timeouts are the restart backoff and each worker's own
internal drain.

The supervisor emits its own L2 heartbeat (``ServiceAuditor("worker_supervisor")``)
carrying a per-worker liveness snapshot, so the ``service_audit`` table gives
one-row-per-minute liveness across all merged workers (incident lesson #4).

Usage
=====
    # all workers (default)
    python -m xyz_agent_context.module.run_worker_supervisor

    # a subset — lets cloud split workers across containers with no code change
    python -m xyz_agent_context.module.run_worker_supervisor --only poller,jobs
    python -m xyz_agent_context.module.run_worker_supervisor --exclude channels

    # split channels themselves (orthogonal to --only), same as the old
    # run_channel_triggers --only:
    python -m xyz_agent_context.module.run_worker_supervisor --only channels --channels lark,slack

The individual workers keep their own ``if __name__ == "__main__"`` blocks as
standalone debugging entrypoints; they are no longer wired into any launcher.
