@description: Managed-mode trigger executor for platform-forwarded IM turns.

Under Manyfold managed mode the platform owns each channel's connection and
cleaning pipeline (dedup / echo filtering / mention gate) and forwards
inbound IM messages as chat turns to ``POST /v1/chat/completions``. That
endpoint maps the turn onto the channel's native semantics
(``build_inbound_run_context``) — but the native channel triggers also carry
per-message BUSINESS hooks that live on the receive path the platform now
holds: WeChat's first-DM owner claim, NarraMessenger's authorize-event gate,
the inbox write, and the error fallback send.

This coordinator is the managed-mode host for those hooks: it constructs one
trigger instance per channel from CHANNEL_TRIGGER_MAP (``start()`` is never
called — no subscribe loops, no connections) and routes
``managed_before_run`` / ``managed_after_run`` around the agent run. It is a
peer of ``run_channel_triggers`` (a coordinator over the trigger registry),
not a Module — modules stay independent (binding rule #3).
