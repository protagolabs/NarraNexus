@description: Server-side caller identity for module MCP tools.

Why this exists (P1, 2026-08-02 线下 / evt_0dcee899)
---------------------------------------------------
Every module MCP server is ONE process shared by all agents, and ~90 tools
across 14 modules take ``agent_id`` as a normal tool parameter — i.e. the
caller's own identity was supplied by the MODEL. The module prompts do state
it ("**IMPORTANT:** Your agent_id is `agent_x`"), but a model that fills the
placeholder it assumes by convention — the observed failure passed the
literal ``agent_id="agent_current"`` — hit a hard dead end:

    Error: No SocialNetworkModule instance found for agent_id=agent_current

...and the agent then told the user it could not do the task. Per iron rule
#15 the platform does not police which model a user picks, so a
machine-knowable fact must not depend on model obedience.

Note the ticket's "inject caller identity OR resolve the agent_current/self
alias" is not a real either/or: the server cannot resolve "the current
agent" without being told who called, because the server is shared. Alias
resolution REQUIRES injection. This module does both halves.

The channel: HTTP headers
-------------------------
Measured 2026-08-01 against both transports the adapters use (probe kept in
the PR description): request headers reach the tool on BOTH the SSE path
(claude, tool calls POST to /messages/) and the streamable-HTTP path
(codex, POST /mcp). A URL query param does NOT survive the SSE path — the
tool-call POST goes to /messages/?session_id=..., so the /sse query string
is gone. Headers are therefore the only channel that works uniformly.

Two header spellings are injected, and either is accepted, because the two
adapters can express different things:
  * ``X-NarraNexus-Agent-Id`` — the honest one. The claude adapter forwards
    arbitrary headers verbatim.
  * ``Authorization: Bearer nx-agent:<agent_id>`` — the codex adapter
    CANNOT carry arbitrary headers (see adapters/codex/official_sdk.py:
    "Codex config cannot carry arbitrary HTTP headers"); a bearer token is
    the one header shape it does transmit. Module MCP servers run no auth,
    so borrowing the header is free — but it IS borrowing, hence the
    ``nx-agent:`` prefix so this can never be confused with a real token.

Injection site: context_runtime's per-agent mcp_servers spec build (one
line, one place — the same spec dict both adapters consume).

Trust model change
------------------
Before this, the server did not verify that ``agent_id`` matched the caller
(documented in references/module_system.md §5 as "运行时是可信的"). When the
header is present it now WINS over the parameter, so one agent can no
longer read another agent's data by passing its id — a hardening side
effect. Every module tool documents ``agent_id`` as "your own id", so
nothing legitimate passes someone else's.

Fail-open, always
-----------------
No header (older adapter, a framework we have not taught yet, a direct
curl) → the parameter is used exactly as before. This module can only
ever ADD identity, never remove the previous behaviour.

# The honest header. Lowercased on lookup — HTTP headers are case-insensitive
# and Starlette normalises them.
AGENT_ID_HEADER = "X-NarraNexus-Agent-Id"

# Marks a borrowed Authorization bearer as OUR identity channel rather than a
# real credential (the codex adapter can only transmit a bearer).
BEARER_AGENT_PREFIX = "nx-agent:"

# WHICH KIND of turn is calling ("chat" / "job" / "message_bus" / …). Same
# injection seam as the identity, because the same problem applies: a tool
# cannot otherwise know whether the turn it serves is an owner-facing errand
# or an agent answering a peer, and message_agent must record that on the
# message (see message_bus_trigger's directive selection).
TURN_SOURCE_HEADER = "X-NarraNexus-Turn-Source"

# WHO owns this turn — the user whose request the agent is serving. Same
# problem, worse failure shape: a model-guessed user_id on job_create still
# CREATES the job (success=True) — under the wrong user, so the owner's Jobs
# list stays empty forever while the agent reports success. Unlike agent_id
# this is resolved placeholder-only (see resolve_caller_user_id): None is a
# legitimate "no filter" value on retrieval tools, and a mismatching real
# value can be legitimate in multi-user flows — measure before overriding.
USER_ID_HEADER = "X-NarraNexus-User-Id"

# WHO/WHERE this turn's own errand is aimed at, when it has one: the peer that
# answered our errand, and the channel that exchange lives in. A bus turn is
# not homogeneous — the same turn can continue our errand AND answer an
# unrelated peer whose question the platform injected (bus unread is collected
# across ALL channels), so "what kind of turn is this" cannot decide the stamp
# alone. The scope lets each SEND compare its own target and stamp itself; see
# message_bus_module/_message_bus_mcp_tools.py::_send_turn_source.
ERRAND_PEER_HEADER = "X-NarraNexus-Errand-Peer"
ERRAND_CHANNEL_HEADER = "X-NarraNexus-Errand-Channel"

# WHICH TRIGGER TREE this turn belongs to (events.root_run_id). Needed because
# a message an agent sends here becomes the trigger for somebody else's run,
# and that run has no other way to learn which tree it continues — the lineage
# would break at exactly this hop. Consumed by the bus send tools, which stamp
# it onto the message they write; the cascade stop then selects a whole tree by
# this one value. A turn with no known tree omits it, and the cascade reads
# NULL as "not part of the tree being stopped".
ROOT_RUN_ID_HEADER = "X-NarraNexus-Root-Run-Id"

# The team whose room this turn is running in, when it is one. Server-side
# because a tool cannot ask the MODEL whether it is in a team: `agent_id` is
# already a model-filled parameter, so a private-chat turn could claim a team
# and write into that team's workspace. Same reasoning as the agent id above.
#
# NOT derivable from ERRAND_CHANNEL: that one is populated only when the turn
# continues the agent's OWN errand (message_bus_trigger stamps it
# conditionally), so it is empty on most team turns and would read as "not a
# team turn" — the failure would be silent and intermittent.
TEAM_ID_HEADER = "X-NarraNexus-Team-Id"

# The events-row id of the turn making the call — this codebase's turn handle
# (same meaning as bus_messages.event_id). Attribution needs to record WHICH
# turn changed an artifact, and the tool cannot ask the model for that without
# accepting a guess. Available because the event row is created in Step 0,
# before context_runtime builds the MCP spec in Step 3.
EVENT_ID_HEADER = "X-NarraNexus-Event-Id"

# The PROOF for everything above: a short-lived Ed25519 JWT signed by the
# platform (cloud: the executor broker at ensure() time; local: the
# agent-runtime process), bound to the turn owner's user_id. The facts before
# it are self-declared conveniences; this one is verifiable — see
# module/identity/ for signing/verification and the enforcement policy.
IDENTITY_TOKEN_HEADER = "X-NarraNexus-Identity-Token"

# Everything above ALSO rides the borrowed bearer, because codex forwards
# nothing else. Shipping a fact only on an explicit header was a real hole
# (PR #229 review): a codex-side asker always wrote NULL turn source, and the
# recipient fell back to the "have I spoken here" heuristic — the one that
# flips a FOLLOW-UP question back to Owner Relay and reproduces the P1. Iron
# rule #15 forbids treating a first-class adapter as a corner.

#
# Contract — pin it, do not improvise:
#   * fields are POSITIONAL and their order is frozen; ``BEARER_FIELDS`` names
#     them in order and is the single source of truth for the count;
#   * trailing empty fields are omitted on the wire, so a reader must tolerate
#     ANY count from 1 to len(BEARER_FIELDS), and an empty middle field is a
#     legal "unknown";
#   * a new fact is APPENDED (never inserted mid-record) and added to
#     ``BEARER_FIELDS``;
#   * parse only via ``_parse_bearer``. A hand-rolled ``split(SEP, 1)`` reads
#     "<turn_source>~<next_field>" as the turn source — that is exactly how
#     adding a third field would have silently poisoned the second, and it is
#     why the two readers here no longer each roll their own;
#   * every field stays token68-safe (RFC 7235): "~" qualifies, and it appears
#     in none of our ids (``agent_`` / ``ch_`` + hex), turn sources or stamps.
