@description: The Awareness half of a rename — the identity record the agent
reads about itself — plus the MCP tool's renderer.

The rename TRANSACTION itself lives in ``xyz_agent_context.agent_profile``
(moved 2026-08-18; it writes the `agents` row and the peer directory, neither of
which is an Awareness concern). What stays here is what genuinely belongs to
Awareness, because it is written into ``instance_awareness``:

* the ``## Identity Changes (platform record)`` section — its constants, the two
  note builders, the reader that lets a new record supersede a stale one, and
  the merge that keeps the rest of the profile intact;
* ``record_identity_change`` / ``reconcile_identity_record``, the two writers
  the transaction calls (public, not underscore-private: they are called across
  a package boundary now);
* ``retire_self_name``, which rewrites the agent's own name line — the one place
  the platform edits agent-authored text, and only ever the name (rule #15: a
  machine-knowable fact is derived, not left to the model to remember);
* ``update_agent_profile_from_args``, the MCP tool's renderer, which calls the
  transaction and formats its result into the sentence the tool has always
  returned. DirectStore (local) and the backend twin route (cloud) both call it,
  so the two stay byte-identical.

Why any of this exists: P1 section 02 ①, prod evt_1f9c6680 — writing
`agents.agent_name` alone left the agent's free-text long-term memory still
asserting the old identity, and the old name may by then belong to a different
agent of the same owner. A column change cannot move a few thousand words of
narrative; a record the agent reads every turn can.

    Measured 2026-08-19 UTC: with the row, BasicInfo, the identity record and the

    model followed the line that came first.
