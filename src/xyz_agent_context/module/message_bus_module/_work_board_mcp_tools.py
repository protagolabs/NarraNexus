@description: MCP tools for the team work board.

A separate file from ``_message_bus_mcp_tools.py`` even though both register
onto the same module's MCP server: the board is a task-level object with its
own state machine and its own platform/model boundary, and mixing it into the
messaging tools would bury that boundary in a 500-line file.

The boundary is the point of this file. A model may open, claim and finish
items. It may NOT write:

  * ``stalled`` — derived by the platform from ``bus_agent_activity`` and
    errand timeouts. Iron rule #15: a correctness-critical fact must not
    depend on model obedience. If a model could assert it, the patrol prompt's
    "these are stalled" section would just be reporting the model's own guess
    back to it.
  * ``paused`` — what a stop leaves behind. An agent that could pause its own
    board could silence patrol, i.e. switch off the supervision this whole
    feature exists to add.
  * ``cancelled`` — the user's call, not an agent's.

    """``(team_id, channel_id)`` for the room this turn is running in.

    Two sources, in this order:

    1. **The server-injected team identity** (``caller_team_id_from_request``).
       This is what the turn can PROVE — the platform stamps it into the MCP
       headers, a model cannot supply it. The room's channel then follows from
       the team, since a team room is deterministically the group channel whose
       ``created_by`` is the ``team_<id>`` marker.
    2. **The ``bus_agent_activity`` mirror**, for turns that carry no injected
       team.

    Order matters, and not only as a preference. This resolver originally had
    source 2 ALONE, and the reasoning was that the mirror row is written by the
    trigger's team branch, so "live activity row in a team-owned channel" is
    exactly when a board exists. That held right up until a second lane started
    running agents in team rooms: patrol wakes the lead outside message
    dispatch, wrote no activity row, and so every board tool answered "no room"
    / "not found" in precisely the turn whose prompt tells the lead to call
    ``team_work_complete``. Deriving from identity removes the dependency on
    another lane remembering to mirror its turn.

    When the two disagree, identity wins: the activity row says where the agent
    was last seen, which can be a room it has since left, and writing an item
    there is a cross-room write with a plausible-looking cause.

    ``(None, None)`` for a peer DM or an owner-chat turn — the tools then
    decline with a reason, which beats inventing a team and writing an item
    nobody will ever see.

    prints `id=` for every item, so last turn's board from team A is sitting in
    the context while this turn runs in team B.
