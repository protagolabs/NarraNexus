@description: MessageBusModule - Agent-to-agent communication via MessageBus

Protocol-agnostic message bus for agent-to-agent communication. Provides MCP
tools for sending/receiving messages, managing channels, and discovering agents.

Instance level: Agent-level (one per Agent, is_public=True).

Behavior design:
- Reply Discipline: prevent infinite trigger loops between agents
- Selective mark_read: a DM the agent ignores stays unread and resurfaces next
  turn. NOT true of a team room, which delivers by rendering its scrollback and
  advances the read cursor once a turn has rendered the window, answered or not
  (a backlog reaching below that window holds the cursor — see `_ack_room_seen`)
- Context caps: unread/channels/known_agents all bounded to prevent pollution
- Source recognition: entries in the unread list are tagged
  [from sender] / [Team X · from sender] (see `_bus_tag`). This is the ONLY place the
  tag appears — a branch that prefixed the turn's INPUT with it was deleted on
  2026-08-17 after it turned out never to have executed; do not describe an
  input prefix here again without checking that one exists

    """How a sender is named inside a `[from … ]` tag.

    THREE kinds of sender reach this list, and only one of them is an agent.
    `schema/team_schema` defines both synthetic prefixes side by side, each
    marked "a non-agent sender":

    * ``usr_<user_id>`` — a PERSON. A team room carries its owner's own
      messages, and the raw id says nothing at all, least of all that the
      reader is looking at the person it works for.
    * ``team_<team_id>`` — the ROOM itself, i.e. the platform. Printing it
      verbatim invents a teammate the agent may then try to @mention back,
      which is exactly why `message_bus_trigger._who` refuses to.
    * anything else — a real agent.

    ``msg_type`` outranks the sender, and has to: a bulletin notice posted
    from the UI carries `msg_type=system_bulletin` but is stamped with the
    OWNER's ``usr_`` id (`team_bulletin.py`, no actor), so on the sender alone
    it reads as the owner speaking — and the Source-Recognition rules now say
    in as many words that a `User` sender is a person. Checking the type first
    is what stops the platform being quoted as the human.

    Named to match `message_bus_trigger._sender`, which renders the same rows
    in the room's own prompt — but the agreement covers only the two synthetic
    kinds: `usr_*` is "User" on both sides and a platform row is
    ``SYSTEM_SENDER_LABEL`` on both. An ORDINARY agent deliberately differs:
    the room prompt resolves it through `member_map` to a display name, while
    this list keeps the raw ``agent_id`` because that is what `message_agent`
    takes. Worth knowing, since a team turn shows both — "Alice: …" in the
    scrollback and `agent_x7f3…` in the list, for one peer.

    Renamed off "MessageBus" on 2026-08-17. The word named a subsystem the agent
    is no longer supposed to know exists — it thinks in "a private message" and
    "a team room", and a tag announcing the transport underneath is a third
    concept doing no work. The acceptance criterion for the redesign is that
    `MessageBus` appears in NO agent-visible text.

    The format had three copies — the worked example in the instructions and
    two render sites — and the example disagreed with both, showing a display
    name AND an id where the code emits a single sender field. That was
    survivable while the tag was decoration. It stopped being survivable when
    the rules started telling the agent to READ the sender out of it: an agent
    following a four-field example against a three-field tag looks for a name
    that is never there, and the field it finds in position two is the channel.

    So the example is generated by this same function, and the two can no
    longer drift apart. ``msg_type`` is optional precisely so the example stays
    constructible from two literals.

    ``where`` was the raw `channel_id` until 2026-08-18, which put a channel id
    on EVERY message row — a harder contradiction of "an agent has private
    conversations and teams, not channels" than the channel list removed the
    same day, because it was unavoidable rather than merely present. It is now
    the team's own name, and only for a team room: in a private conversation
    the sender IS the conversation, so a second field would be the same fact
    twice. Empty renders the short form.

        has — the top-N channel list this replaces was a per-turn query for a
        block nobody read, whereas every row this labels is printed.

        Never raises and never guesses: a channel it cannot resolve is simply
        absent, and the renderer falls back to the private-conversation form.
        Mislabelling a private message as a room would be worse than a missing

        Goes through `AsyncDatabaseClient`, NOT `bus._db`. `LocalMessageBus`
        stores the RAW backend verbatim, and the raw SQLite backend hands SQL to
        aiosqlite unmodified — `%s` is not a placeholder there. So these two
