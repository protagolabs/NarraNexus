@description: The single tiered MIME-type sniffer for uploaded/ingested bytes.

One implementation for every entry point that receives file bytes plus
untrusted naming metadata (browser uploads, IM-channel downloads, team-chat
uploads). Before this module each entry point carried its own copy with
subtly different tiering — a ``.md`` upload could classify as
``application/octet-stream`` on one path and ``text/markdown`` on another,
which changes the derived category (thumbnail vs grey chip) and whether
Whisper transcription runs (``audio/*``).

Tier order (first hit wins):

1. libmagic content sniff (python-magic dep + system libmagic1; still guarded
   by ImportError so a host without the native lib degrades instead of
   crashing) — but a "no info" verdict (``application/octet-stream`` or the
   ``x-empty`` / ``inode/x-empty`` reported for zero-byte input) means "no
   idea", so it falls through instead of masking the later tiers.
2. Extension guess via ``mimetypes.guess_type``.
3. The client/platform-supplied type (browser ``Content-Type`` or IM
   platform metadata) as a last resort — user-controlled, never primary.
4. ``application/octet-stream``.

Tiers 1 and 2 run through ``_audio_video_container_override``: WebM/Ogg/MP4
are containers whose header looks identical for audio-only and audio+video
streams, so libmagic (and the extension table) report ``video/<container>``
for in-browser voice memos. If the client explicitly tagged the SAME
container as ``audio/``, trust it as the tiebreaker — misclassification is
contained (Whisper no-ops on non-audio bytes) and this unblocks recorded
audio-only clips.
