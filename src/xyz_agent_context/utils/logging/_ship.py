@description: Network log sink — the PUSH half of the observability
design (pull half = the manyfold diagnostics endpoints; the two share
no machinery on purpose).

``setup_logging`` registers this as one more loguru sink; the file sink
stays the source of truth and this ships a copy to the collector
(scripts/diag_collector). This is product TELEMETRY, not an operator
feature: no deployer has to configure anything, and the authorization
basis is the user's own consent.

Consent resolution (first match wins):
  1. ``NEXUS_DIAG_SHIP`` env — explicit override: ``off`` silences,
     ``meta``/``full`` force a level (dev/self-host knob, and the test
     suite's kill switch).
  2. Opt-out marker file ``~/.narranexus/telemetry_optout`` (path
     overridable via ``NEXUS_DIAG_OPTOUT_FILE`` — containerized
     self-hosts must point every service at ONE mounted path) — written
     by the settings UI (``set_telemetry_optout``) when the user turns
     telemetry off. DURABILITY IS A MOUNT PROPERTY: the marker survives
     exactly as long as the filesystem under its path does. In a
     container, HOME is writable layer — a rebuild would silently
     revert an opted-out full-level sandbox to shipping — so run.sh
     container mode points the marker at /data (the persisted volume).
     Anyone touching the Dockerfile HOME/volume layout is touching
     consent state. Withdrawal is honoured WITHOUT a restart: ``_send``
     re-checks consent on every egress, so an opt-out written mid-run
     silences shipping within one flush interval. Re-enabling needs a
     restart ONLY when telemetry was already off at process start (no
     sink was registered then); a mid-run off→on flip resumes at the
     next flush through the same gate. The file is PER-MACHINE: callers on
     multi-tenant surfaces must gate the write themselves (the backend
     route refuses it in cloud mode).
  3. Managed default: ``NEXUS_DIAG_DEFAULT_SHIP`` (``meta``/``full``)
     — a DEFAULT-layer input, not an override: it changes what applies
     when the user has expressed nothing, and the opt-out marker still
     wins. This is how our run.sh container mode gives manyfold
     sandboxes ``full`` (joint-support debugging is their telemetry's
     purpose) WITHOUT confiscating the user's switch — an env override
     here would grey the toggle and 409 the PUT, hollowing out the
     consent design on exactly the single-tenant user runtime it was
     built for. Invalid/absent values fall through; ``off`` is not
     accepted (a deployment that wants silence sets NEXUS_DIAG_SHIP).
  4. Default: ``_DEFAULT_MODE`` = **meta** — the consent basis (the
     first-run disclosure + settings toggle) shipped in the same
     change that flipped this from off, never apart. meta (no INFO
     bodies) is the highest level the base disclosure copy honestly
     describes; the copy names the full-level content for surfaces
     that run full. Single-tenant surfaces (desktop, local, sprite
     sandboxes) show the toggle — sandboxes run full via the managed
     default and can still opt out; multi-tenant cloud is governed by
     the deployment env instead.

  meta — AUDIT (25) and up: structured lifecycle events + warnings,
         no INFO bodies.
  full — everything the file sink sees, at its resolved level.

Ingest URL resolution (first match wins):
  1. ``NEXUS_DIAG_SHIP_URL`` env — direct override (points a dev/self-
     hosted deployment at its own collector; skips discovery).
  2. Discovery: ``GET <NEXUS_DIAG_DISCOVERY_URL or the built-in
     https://agent.narra.nexus/telemetry/v1/config>`` returns
     ``{"ingest": {"default": url, "staging": url, ...}}``; the sender
     picks by its env label — ``NEXUS_DIAG_ENV`` > ``NARRA_SURFACE`` >
     deployment mode ("cloud"/"local") — falling back to the map's
     "default" entry. Deployment-specific label derivation (e.g.
     manyfold staging detection) lives in run.sh container mode, which
     injects ``NEXUS_DIAG_ENV`` — this utility reads no other
     integration's env vars. THREE-SIDED CONTRACT — a label lives in
     three places and introducing one means updating all three:
     (1) the sender's env label (here); (2) the collector's
     ``DIAG_COLLECT_KNOWN_ENVS``, which decides the STORAGE PARTITION
     (a label missing there is demoted into unknown/, the partition
     its size cap drains first); (3) the discovery document's ingest
     map, which decides the RECEIVING HOST — ``mapping.get(label)``
     falls back to "default", so a label missing from the map silently
     ships to the default (prod) collector with no warning on either
     side.

     The document is fetched LAZILY on the worker thread with a TTL
     cache — never at setup, so process start and test runs touch no
     network. Unresolvable discovery leaves the sink idle until the
     next probe.

No client secret: the repository is open source, so a baked or shared
token authenticates nothing — the collector is a public endpoint
hardened by abuse controls (size caps, rate limits), and a spoofed
envelope only pollutes our own diagnostics. ``NEXUS_DIAG_SHIP_TOKEN``
remains an optional knob for private collectors.

The ship level is enforced at loguru dispatch (the sink is registered
WITH that minimum level), so filtered records cost nothing.

Delivery contract — never interfere with the process being observed:
- ``enqueue=True`` gives this sink its own queue + worker thread; the
  emitting coroutine never waits on the network, and a slow collector
  cannot back up the FILE sink (separate queue).
- Batches flush at ``_BATCH_MAX`` records, ``_BATCH_MAX_BYTES``
  serialized bytes (half the collector's 8MB wire cap, gzip headroom —
  count-only batching can exceed a byte-capped receiver), or
  ``_FLUSH_INTERVAL_S`` seconds. Send failures DROP the batch after a
  short timeout — the file sink still has every line; gaps are pulled
  via the diagnostics endpoints. Failures report via ``sys.stderr``
  (never through loguru: a failing ship must not emit into itself).
- Circuit breaker: ``_BREAKER_THRESHOLD`` consecutive TRANSIENT
  failures OPEN it for ``_BREAKER_COOLDOWN_S`` — records drop at the
  door instead of buffering (a dead collector must not become a memory
  leak: the enqueue queue is unbounded while the drain rate is floored
  at timeout×batch). After the cooldown the breaker goes HALF-OPEN:
  traffic is admitted for one probe batch, whose failure re-opens
  IMMEDIATELY (no re-earning the threshold) and whose success closes
  fully. Permanent rejections (4xx: over-size, auth misconfig) drop
  the batch WITHOUT feeding the breaker — "this batch is unacceptable"
  is not "the collector is down".
- ONE module-level ``atexit`` handler flushes every live sink on clean
  exit (final shutdown otherwise loses the last interval forever;
  startup backfill only helps when the SAME service starts again).
  Sinks are tracked in a ``WeakSet`` — per-instance atexit handlers
  would pin every sink ever constructed and stack serial timeouts.
- On registration, the tail of today's existing log file is shipped
  once with ``"backfill": true`` — the crash-tail catch-up, so lines
  written just before an unclean restart still reach the collector.

Identity: every record carries the envelope fields
``(env, runtime_id, host, service)`` merged flat — the collector
partitions by them, and on a sprite (single manyfold runtime) that
makes every line attributable without per-line agent binding.
