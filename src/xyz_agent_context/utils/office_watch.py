@description: Shared constants + helpers for the live Office-document preview
(officecli watch). Used by the backend office-watch routes
(`backend/routes/office_watch/proxy.py`): the `/office-watch/open` endpoint
ensures a watch is running for an office artifact and the reverse-proxy streams
it to the browser.

Design: an office document registered as an artifact renders live. When its
tab is viewed, the backend `open` endpoint calls `ensure_watch`, which
ALLOCATES a dedicated port for that file (injective — never two files on one
port, so several docs can be previewed at once without cross-wiring one tab
onto another's document) and spawns a DETACHED `officecli watch` on it
(co-located with the agent's officecli edits, so it shares the resident and
live-refreshes over SSE), then returns the port so `open` can mint a signed
proxy URL. The port range is also a security allowlist — the proxy refuses to
dial anything outside it, so it can never become an SSRF into other
in-container ports (e.g. the executor :8020 or sqlite :8100).
