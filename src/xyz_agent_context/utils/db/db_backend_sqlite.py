@description: SQLite implementation of the DatabaseBackend interface

Uses aiosqlite for async SQLite access. Designed for local/desktop use
(Tauri 2 migration) with WAL journal mode for concurrent read support.

Key design decisions:
- Single long-lived connection (not a pool) since SQLite is file-based
- asyncio.Lock for write serialization (SQLite allows only one writer)
- WAL mode enables concurrent readers even during writes
- JSON/dict/list values serialized to JSON strings for storage
- Boolean values stored as 0/1 integers
- datetime values stored as ISO 8601 strings

# =============================================================================
# aiosqlite worker-thread hardening
# =============================================================================
#
# aiosqlite runs every connection on its own worker thread and hands results
# back with `future.get_loop().call_soon_threadsafe(...)`. If the loop that
# issued the statement has been closed in the meantime, that call raises
# RuntimeError — and upstream's handler answers by making the SAME call again
# from its `except` block, which raises again, uncaught. The worker thread
# then DIES, silently, still owning an open sqlite3 connection.
#
# Nothing reclaims that connection. It keeps its file handle and whatever lock
# the abandoned statement held, so every later writer waits out
# `busy_timeout` (30s) on each of `_MAX_WRITE_RETRIES` (10) attempts —
# ~5 minutes of blocking per collision, then "database is locked".
#
# A closed loop is not exotic here. The trigger is a SHORT-LIVED loop, and this
# codebase mints them on purpose:
#   * `get_db_client_sync()` builds its client inside `asyncio.run(...)`, whose
#     loop is dead the instant it returns (`db_factory.py`). `ContextRuntime`
#     takes that path whenever no client is injected, and `module_runner.py`
#     already carries two comments about the fallout.
#   * `lark_trigger.py` makes a fresh loop per WS reconnect.
#   * The test harness, and any one-shot script or migration.
# A fire-and-forget DB task caught by its loop's shutdown is the other half
# (`schedule_user_no_quota_rearm` is one) — though that one rides the uvicorn
# main loop, so it only bites at server shutdown.
#
# NOT the MCP container: `module_runner.py` gives each module its own PROCESS
# with one process-lifetime `asyncio.run`, no threaded loops. An earlier draft
# of this comment claimed otherwise and would have sent the next reader into
# MCP code to look for something that is not there.
#
# So: keep the thread alive. If the awaiting coroutine's loop is gone, the
# result has no one to go to and dropping it is correct — dying is not, because
# this thread is the only one that can ever close the connection. This is the
# project's incident lesson #2 (third-party fire-and-forget is a mine too)
# applied to aiosqlite, and it is narrow on purpose: only the delivery step is
# replaced, the queue protocol and the STOP sentinel are upstream's.

# The worker must also be a DAEMON thread, and the two halves are one fix.
#
# Upstream creates it with a bare `Thread(target=...)`, i.e. daemon=False, and
# relied — by accident — on the delivery crash above to reap orphans: a worker
# that dies lets the process exit. Keeping it alive without this half converts
# "5 minutes of blocked writes" into "the process never exits at all",
# because `Py_FinalizeEx` runs `threading._shutdown()` (which JOINS non-daemon
# threads) BEFORE module teardown, so `Connection.__del__ -> stop()` never gets
# its chance. Measured on 2026-08-17 with a connection orphaned behind a
# `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`: upstream exits in 1.4s, delivery-patch-only hangs forever.
#
# That regression would have landed on the desktop build (SQLite IS the desktop
# backend, binding rule #7) as "quit leaves a zombie holding the DB file", and
# in containers as a SIGKILL on every `docker stop`. Strictly harder to diagnose
# than the slowness it replaced.
#
# Daemon status can only be set before `start()`, and aiosqlite starts the
# thread in `Connection.__await__` — so it has to happen in the constructor.
# Setting it in `SQLiteBackend.initialize()` after `await aiosqlite.connect()`
# raises "cannot set daemon status of active thread".
#
# This does NOT license a weaker shutdown path: a daemon worker can be killed
# mid-write at exit (safe — WAL is crash-safe, same as SIGKILL), but the
# ORDINARY close must stay explicit. `close_db_client()` and the suite's
# `pytest_sessionfinish` are still load-bearing.
# Assigning to an attribute upstream has renamed away succeeds SILENTLY, which
# would turn both halves of this hardening into a no-op and bring the 5-minute
# lock class back with a green suite. Fail at import instead — the version floor
# in pyproject.toml rules out OLDER releases that never had these names; only
# this check can catch a NEWER one that renames them, which is why it exists.
# Two tests additionally assert both patches are installed.
# The complete internal surface this module touches, in three kinds — say it this
# way and the next person adding an `aiosqlite.core.X` reference knows which
# bucket theirs falls in:
#   * resolved at call time by `_resilient_connection_worker_thread`: `LOG`,
#     `set_result`, `_STOP_RUNNING_SENTINEL`, `set_exception`;
#   * the ASSIGNMENT target it replaces: `_connection_worker_thread`, never read
#     here, and guarded for the reason the paragraph above gives;
#   * the class whose constructor gets wrapped: `Connection`.
#
# `Connection.__init__` is deliberately NOT in this tuple: `hasattr(cls,
# "__init__")` is true for every class in Python, so such a check is a tautology
# (one was here and was deleted). Its real guard is the `hasattr(self, "_thread")`
# check inside `_daemon_worker_connection_init`.
#
# `set_result` / `set_exception` are the ones that must not be missed: they are
# READS, so a rename does not degrade quietly — it raises AttributeError inside
# the worker's `try`, lands in `except BaseException`, and the handler's own
# `aiosqlite.core.set_exception` raises again with nobody left to catch it. The
# worker thread dies holding an open connection, which is the exact failure this
# whole module exists to remove, now as a daemon thread and therefore quieter.
