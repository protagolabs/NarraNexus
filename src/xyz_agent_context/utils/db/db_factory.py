Database Factory - Per-event-loop database client registry

@file_name: db_factory.py
@author: NetMind.AI
@date: 2025-11-28
@description: Provides a database client keyed by the running asyncio event loop.

=============================================================================
Design Goals
=============================================================================

Problems solved:
- 40+ direct DatabaseClient() calls in code, each creating a new connection
- MCP tools cannot accept externally injected db_client (Agent cannot pass it)
- Uncontrollable connection count, may exhaust database connections
- Cross-loop pool misuse: a single process-wide singleton breaks the moment a
  second event loop touches it -- the aiomysql pool binds its internal Futures
  (e.g. Pool._wakeup) to the loop that created it, and reusing that pool from
  another loop raises "got Future attached to a different loop". The earlier
  mitigation (evict + recreate on loop change) only pushed the problem around:
  whichever loop lost the race held stale Futures until the next access.
  (2026-08-17: this used to read "the MCP container runs each module in its own
  threaded event loop". It does not -- `module_runner.py` gives each module its
  own PROCESS with one process-lifetime `asyncio.run`. The real multi-loop
  sources are `get_db_client_sync`'s throwaway `asyncio.run`, `lark_trigger`'s
  per-reconnect loop, one-shot scripts and the test harness. The mechanism the
  paragraph describes is unchanged; only the example was wrong, and it was
  sending readers into MCP code to look for something that is not there.)

Solution:
- One AsyncDatabaseClient per event loop (keyed by id(loop))
- Each loop builds its own pool, lives as long as the loop is alive
- Closed loops are CLOSED and evicted on every access (O(n) over active
  loops, under one bounded budget -- see _evict_closed_loops)
- A per-loop asyncio.Lock serialises concurrent first-call on the same loop
- Legacy `get_db_client_sync` path preserved as an escape hatch for
  bootstrap code (its returned client must not be reused from async code)

Usage examples:
    # Async acquisition (recommended)
    db = await get_db_client()

    # Sync acquisition (bootstrap only; never reuse result from async code)
    db = get_db_client_sync()

    # Usage in MCP tools
    @mcp.tool()
    async def job_create(...) -> dict:
        db = await get_db_client()
        module = JobModule(database_client=db)

async def _evict_closed_loops() -> None:
    """Close, then drop, every entry whose loop has been closed.

    Important for long-running processes that spawn short-lived loops — the
    test harness, one-shot scripts, `lark_trigger`'s per-reconnect loop, and
    `get_db_client_sync`'s own `asyncio.run`. Without this, the entry would
    linger and a new loop later allocated at the same memory address could
    accidentally collide on id().

    **Forgetting the client is not the same as releasing it.** An evicted
    client still owns a live backend connection — for SQLite, an aiosqlite
    worker thread holding an open handle on the database file, and, if the
    loop died mid-write, an open WRITE transaction that nothing will ever
    commit or roll back. The WAL write lock is then held for the remaining
    life of the process, and every later writer pays
    `_MAX_WRITE_RETRIES` (10) x `busy_timeout` (30s) = ~5 minutes of silent
    blocking before it finally raises "database is locked" (2026-08-17: this
    was 92% of the test suite's 38-minute wall clock, and it is the same
    shape as a local desktop install wedging its own writes).

    The origin loop is closed by definition here, so the close runs on the
    CURRENT loop — aiosqlite needs *a* running loop to close, not the one that
    opened the connection (same reasoning as `close_db_client`).

    Two honest limits, both worth stating because the headline above oversells
    without them:

    * **Reclamation is effective for SQLite only.** `MySQLBackend.close()` goes
      through `pool.wait_closed()`, which drives `conn.close()` →
      `loop.call_soon(...)` on the dead loop and waits on a `Condition` bound to
      it. On MySQL this reliably fails rather than reclaiming, and the warning
      below is all you get. Not yet verified against a live MySQL, so no fix is
      claimed here — for MySQL this function still only stops the id() collision.
    * **`SYNC_KEY` is out of reach.** `get_db_client_sync()` registers under
      `_clients_by_loop[SYNC_KEY]` and never touches `_loops_by_id`, which is
      what `stale_ids` is derived from — so the one client guaranteed to have a
      dead loop is structurally excluded. Only `close_db_client()` reclaims it.
      Making it evictable means the first `await get_db_client()` in a process
      would close the bootstrap client out from under whoever still holds it;
      that needs its own audit of `get_db_client_sync` callers.

    Bounded by ONE deadline for the whole sweep, not per entry: `stale_ids` is
    as long as the caller's loop churn made it, and this runs on every
    acquisition ahead of the cached-hit return — a per-entry timeout would let
    whoever churns loops set the latency paid by whoever next asks for a client.

    Typically called when the application shuts down. For each client we

    `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe` — closing a client from the wrong
    loop would trigger the same cross-loop errors we're trying to avoid.
    If the origin loop is already closed, we close on the CURRENT loop

    DAEMON thread, so that hang is gone and this call can no longer be
