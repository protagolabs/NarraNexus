@description: SSRF-safety primitive for server-side outbound HTTP.

Any time the SERVER fetches a user- or agent-supplied URL (the URL-tab embed
probe today; the headless RenderService / streaming browser later), it can be
tricked into hitting internal services — the classic SSRF vector, and on
EC2 the cloud metadata endpoint `169.254.169.254`. This module is the single
gate every such fetch must pass through.

Deliberately generic and dependency-light (stdlib only, injectable resolver)
so it lives in `utils/` with no artifact coupling — the RenderService and the
streaming browser will import the same function.

Note the trust boundary: this guards requests WE originate server-side. An
`<iframe src>` is fetched by the USER's browser, not us, so it is not on this
SSRF surface — but open_url still validates the initial URL here to refuse
obviously-internal targets early.
