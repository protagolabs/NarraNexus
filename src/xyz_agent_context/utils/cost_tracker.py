@description: LLM API cost calculation and recording utility

Provides centralized cost tracking for all LLM API calls:
- Claude (agent_loop)
- OpenAI GPT (llm_function)
- Gemini (llm_function)

Architecture:
    Pure functions + async recorder + global cost context.
    AgentRuntime sets the cost context once at the start of run(),
    and all subsequent LLM calls automatically record costs without
    needing explicit agent_id/db parameters.
