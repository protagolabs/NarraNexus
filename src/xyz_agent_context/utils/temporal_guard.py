@description: Diagnostic check for date claims an agent makes about "now".

What this is
------------
An observability probe, NOT a filter. It reads what the agent already said
and records a signal when a claim about today's date contradicts the turn's
ground-truth clock. It never rewrites a reply, never blocks delivery, never
asks the model to try again, and never influences agent_loop in any way.

That restraint is the design, not a limitation. 铁律 #15 and #16 say the
platform is not the interruption source and must not degrade what the user
sees; an output filter that "corrects" the model would be exactly that. And
the incident lessons in CLAUDE.md are explicit that the useful thing here is
an L2/L3 signal in the database (§4, §5): a missing or contradicted business
event is evidence you can query, whereas a log grep is only as good as the
keyword someone guessed.

So the deal is: prompts and tools try to prevent the mistake; this tells us
honestly how often prevention is failing, on real traffic, without touching
the traffic.

What it checks
--------------
Only DIRECT assertions about the current date — "今天是 8 月 8 日", "today is
Friday", "现在是 2026-08-08". These are checkable against one number with no
interpretation, which is what keeps the signal worth reading.

It deliberately does NOT try to catch the general case ("the event is coming
up", "that's next week"), because deciding whether those are wrong needs the
surrounding context and would produce a stream of maybes. A probe nobody
trusts gets muted, and a muted probe is worse than none: it looks like
coverage. Narrow and reliable beats broad and noisy.

Chinese and English are both handled because both appear in production
replies, often in the same message.
