# ArtifactPreviewCard.tsx — Inline chat thumbnail for artifact references

## Why it exists

When the agent emits a tool result that creates or references an artifact, the chat thread needs a compact, tappable summary so the user knows what was produced without having to navigate away. This card bridges the chat column and the artifact column: it renders a preview in-place and, on click, focuses the ArtifactColumn on the matching tab.

## Upstream / Downstream

- **Rendered by**: `MessageBubble` (or a future ToolResultBlock) when a tool result payload includes an `artifact_id`.
- **Reads from**: `artifactStore` (for `setActive` / `setCollapsed`). Also makes a direct `fetch()` call to `rawUrl()` for csv/markdown thumbnails.
- **Activates**: `ArtifactColumn` indirectly, via `setCollapsed(false)` + `setActive(artifact_id)`.

## Thumbnail strategy

| Kind | What is shown | Why |
|------|--------------|-----|
| `image/png` / `image/jpeg` | `<img>` pointing at rawUrl | Native browser image decode, no extra fetch needed beyond the img request itself |
| `text/csv` | First 5 rows × first 5 columns via `fetch().then(text)` | Gives at-a-glance data preview; full render needs CsvRenderer |
| `text/markdown` | First 200 chars of the raw text | Fast, avoids pulling in a Markdown renderer just for a thumbnail |
| `application/vnd.echarts+json` | Placeholder label | ECharts requires a full canvas + JS bundle; pointless to partially instantiate in a thumbnail |
| `text/html` | Placeholder label | Same sandboxing complexity as full HtmlRenderer; a thumbnail iframe adds no value |
| `application/pdf` | Placeholder label | Browser PDF viewer must be full-size; thumbnail is not meaningful |

## Design decisions

**Eager fetch for csv/markdown only**: The `useEffect` fires only for the two kinds where a plain text fetch is sufficient to produce a useful thumbnail. Image kinds use a plain `<img>` tag (the browser manages the request). All other kinds skip network activity entirely.

**Click handler order**: `setCollapsed(false)` must be called before `setActive()`. If the column is collapsed and `setActive` fires first, the tab strip might re-render into a collapsed state that is immediately replaced — the ordering avoids a flash.

**No `rounded` corners**: The rest of the UI uses sharp right-angle rectangles (Nordic archive aesthetic). The card uses `border border-[var(--border-default)]` with no border-radius to match.

## Gotchas

The `useEffect` dependency array uses stable scalar fields `(kind, agent_id, artifact_id, latest_version)` instead of the full `artifact` object. This prevents refetch storms when the parent re-renders with a new object reference but identical data. The four fields are sufficient to uniquely identify both the artifact and the version being previewed.

**Error path (I3, 2026-05-09)**: The fetch chain now checks `r.ok` and catches network errors. A `previewError` state slot stores the error string; when set, a small red fallback line renders below the thumbnail area. The effect uses an async IIFE (matching ChartRenderer's pattern) so that the `setPreviewError(null)` reset and the async `setPreviewError(String(e))` are in the same async microtask batch — required by `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` (eslint-plugin-react-hooks v7).

**No spinner-forever bug**: Previously, a failed fetch would leave csvHead/mdHead as null with no error indicator, producing an empty 80px div with no feedback. The error path makes the failure visible.
