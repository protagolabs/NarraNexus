# MainLayout.tsx — Three-column app shell and React Router layout

## 为什么存在

React Router renders this as the layout wrapper for all `/app/*` routes. It decides whether to show the default `ChatView` (chat + right panel) or delegate to `<Outlet />` for sub-pages like Settings and System.

## 上下游关系
- **被谁用**: React Router route config (`/app` layout route).
- **依赖谁**: `Sidebar`, `ChatPanel`, `ContextPanelHeader`, `ContextPanelContent`, `AgentCompletionToast`, `usePreloadStore`, `useConfigStore`, `useAutoRefresh`.

## 设计决策

`isSubPage` is detected by checking `location.pathname` — if not `/app/chat` or `/app`, the `<Outlet />` gets the full remaining width with no right panel. This avoids needing a nested router layout for each sub-page.

`ChatView` is a separate named export (not inline) so it can be referenced without instantiating `MainLayout`. It owns the `ContextTab` state — the right-panel tab selection does not persist across navigation.

`preloadAll` is called whenever `agentId` or `userId` changes. This is the entry-point for populating `usePreloadStore` with awareness, social network, inbox, and other agent-specific data.

## Gotcha / 边界情况

`onAgentComplete` is passed to `ChatPanel` as a callback that calls `refreshAll` from `useAutoRefresh`. This is the mechanism that refreshes the right-panel data after an agent run finishes.
