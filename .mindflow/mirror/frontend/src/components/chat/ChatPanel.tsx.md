## 2026-06-25 — two chat tabs: Conversation | Inner Thoughts

A `chatTab` state (`'conversation' | 'inner'`) with a tab bar under the header.
The agent runtime already tags output distinctly, so this is pure frontend
routing — no backend change.

- **Conversation**: the original design, unchanged — full reply bubble + the
  inline "reasoning & tools" disclosure + the live streaming `TurnTimeline`
  (+ "starting up" indicator). It just stops rendering the items that belong to
  Inner Thoughts.
- **Inner Thoughts**: everything that is NOT an owner↔agent direct chat turn:
    - `messageType:'activity'` → compact centered line ("Background activity (discord)").
    - any turn whose `workingSource` is **not** `chat`/`manyfold` (discord /
      slack / telegram / lark / wechat / message_bus / job / a2a …) → full
      readable bubble. Catches the agent's cross-channel narrations
      (`owner_notify_content` "I replied to a Discord user / notified you")
      which the backend surfaces as real replies (message_type stays `chat`),
      so an activity-only filter would miss them.
  No live stream here (post-hoc feed); streaming stays in Conversation.

The `chat`/`manyfold` user-facing set mirrors `_USER_FACING_SOURCES` in
`backend/routes/agents_chat_history.py`. Routing: `if (chatTab === 'inner' ?
!isInner : isInner) return null;`. `MessageBubble` is unchanged.

## 2026-06-20 — design-ref pass: binding-dot header, JourneyBand empty state, Connected footer

Three changes aligning with the Narra Agent App design ref:

- **Header**: the lone `StatusDot` is replaced by [[identity|BindingDot]]
  (carbon·silicon motif) before the `[ Interaction <agent> ]` label; it
  `pulse`s while streaming, keeping the live cue the StatusDot carried.
- **Empty state**: with an agent selected, the generic "Start a conversation"
  bracket is replaced by [[OnboardingJourney]] (binding-dot eyebrow,
  memory→network→team stations, suggested-prompt chips). With NO agent it still
  shows the plain `BracketEmptyState` ("Select an agent"). Note the brand-new
  unnamed-agent path is unchanged — `showBootstrapGreeting` (BOOTSTRAP_GREETING
  "I just woke up" bubble) takes precedence over `showEmptyState`, so the two
  never collide.
- **Composer footer**: briefly carried Enter/Shift+Enter/Drop hints + a
  readiness indicator, but both were **removed** (clawcreek-style minimal
  composer). The send button now uses the `CornerDownLeft` (↵) glyph and a
  `title="Send (Enter)"` so the button itself signals "Enter sends" — no
  separate hint row. (StatusDot/Kbd imports dropped with it.)

Suggested-prompt chips call `composerRef.current.setText(...)` (see
[[Composer]]) — fill, don't send.

## 2026-06-11 (v1.8.1) — clickable Processing chip + header truncation

The Processing indicator is now [[ExecutionPopover]] — click opens a
live pipeline-step list (the execution view retired with RuntimePanel,
resurrected as click-to-peek). Header left side gained
overflow-hidden + agent-id truncation so a narrow chat (artifact
column open) can never run the label under the Processing/cost cluster.

## 2026-06-11 — CostPopover joins the header row

The cost chip used to float `absolute top-2 right-2` over the chat
card (MainLayout) and collided with this header's Processing indicator
during runs. It is now a proper flex member of the header's right
side, next to Processing — no overlap possible. Carries the
`chat.cost` help anchor.

## 2026-05-29 — defer streaming values to throttle render bursts (F5)

The five high-frequency streaming values from chatStore
(currentAssistantMessage / currentThinking / currentSteps /
currentToolCalls / currentEvents) are read into `_rt*` locals then wrapped
in `useDeferredValue` so React coalesces a streaming storm into fewer
commits while always converging to the latest value (iron rule #16:
throttle render rate, never drop/reorder content). `messages` stays
immediate (the timeline dedup depends on it). Pure render-scheduling —
the chatStore delta-merge logic is untouched. Effect (fewer renders under
load) is only observable via real-browser profiling.

## 2026-05-22 — chat input extracted to <Composer> (typing-lag fix)

The message textarea + its draft text used to be `input` state living right
here. Because this component subscribes to the **whole** chat store
(`useChatStore()` with no selector) it re-renders on every streaming delta;
with `input` also here, every keystroke re-rendered this 1300-line monolith,
and typing *while an agent streamed* (esp. one-char-per-token models) made the
two re-render storms collide → laggy input.

The text now lives in `Composer.tsx`. ChatPanel reads it imperatively on send
(`composerRef.getText()`), clears it after a successful send
(`composerRef.clear()`), and tracks only the empty↔non-empty flip
(`composerEmpty`) for the Send button. The drag/paste handlers are passed down
as **stable** wrappers (`stableSubmit`/`stableDrag*` via a ref) so the memoized
Composer doesn't re-render when ChatPanel does. Draft persistence (was a
per-keystroke synchronous localStorage write) is now debounced inside Composer.
`key={agentId}` remounts Composer on agent switch to restore that agent's draft.
铁律 #16: pure render isolation — no message content is dropped or throttled.

## 2026-05-20 — streaming avatar: Bot icon → name-driven RingAvatar

Both in-flight streaming rows (the "events arriving" branch and the
"Starting up…" branch) used to render a hardcoded lucide `<Bot>` icon as the
left avatar — the "old robot" that didn't match the agent's real identity or
the historical `MessageBubble` avatar. Replaced both with
`<RingAvatar species="silicon" label={(currentAgent?.name || agentId || 'AI').slice(0, 2)} />`,
so the live turn shows the same name-initial avatar as finished turns and the
sidebar. Also threads `agentName={currentAgent?.name || agentId}` into
`MessageBubble` (see its mirror md). `Bot` import dropped (now unused).

## 2026-05-15 — artifact card → inline badge

`ArtifactToolCallCards` no longer renders `<ArtifactPreviewCard>` (the full-sized thumbnail with CSV/image/markdown previews). It now emits one `<ArtifactInlineBadge>` chip per **unique** artifact_id in the turn. Re-register on the same artifact is deduped down to a single badge. The card was visually disruptive (re-registers re-mounted it, producing a "flash and disappear" feeling) and the right-side ArtifactColumn is the canonical place to view content — the badge is just an affordance to jump there. ArtifactPreviewCard is kept in `components/artifacts/` for potential future re-use but is no longer mounted from chat.

## 2026-05-15 — re-register signal: refetch (not ensure-loaded)

`ensureArtifactLoaded` (which short-circuited on "already in store") was
replaced with `refreshArtifactFromToolCall(agentId, artifactId, dedupKey)`.
Reason: a `register_artifact` call with `target_artifact_id=<existing>` is
the agent's refresh signal — same `artifact_id` arrives in the tool stream
but with a bumped `updated_at`. The old guard would skip the fetch and
renderers would never see the new timestamp, so the iframe wouldn't
reload. The new helper always refetches, deduped per tool call by a key
built from `tc.step + tc.tool_output` so the render loop doesn't trigger
infinite refetches. The seen-Set is module-scope (small bounded growth
per session, no leak concern).

## 2026-05-14 — artifact tool name collapsed to `register_artifact`

Spec: `reference/self_notebook/specs/2026-05-14-artifact-pointer-model-design.md`

`ARTIFACT_TOOL_BASE_NAMES` is now `['register_artifact']` (was
`['create_artifact', 'upload_artifact_file']`). The frontend's live artifact
discovery keys off this list to recognise tool calls in the agent stream
and surface `ArtifactPreviewCard`s — must stay in lockstep with the
`@mcp.tool(name=...)` registration in `artifact_tool.py`. Also updated the
`ensureArtifactLoaded` helper because `artifactsApi.getDetail` now returns
`Artifact` directly (no `{artifact, versions}` wrapper).

## 2026-05-14 — timeline dedup extracted; event_id-based dedup

The unified-timeline merge + dedup (a ~50-line block inside the `timeline`
`useMemo`) was extracted into the pure, unit-tested
`[[buildTimeline.ts]]` — `buildUnifiedTimeline(historyMessages, messages)`.
The `TimelineItem` type moved there too; ChatPanel imports both.

The dedup itself was upgraded: **`(role, event_id)` exact match** instead
of the old `${role}:${content}` exact-string key. The string key missed
whenever the session-assembled content drifted from the DB-persisted
content by even one whitespace char (two independent code paths) — that
was the "latest reply shown twice" bug. Session messages now carry
`event_id` (stamped by `[[chatStore.ts]]`); see `[[buildTimeline.ts]]`
for the full dedup contract. The old `role:content` + window + consume
logic survives only as the fallback for event-id-less messages.

The "Match-and-consume semantics" / "5 min window" notes in the v2.4
section below still describe the **fallback** path accurately, but the
primary path is now event_id.

## 2026-05-14 — artifact tool-name matching must tolerate the `mcp__…__` prefix

**Bug:** the artifact panel never updated during/after a run — the
artifact only appeared on an unrelated reload (agent switch). Root cause
was here: MCP tools arrive in the event stream **fully-qualified** —
`mcp__<server>__<tool>`, e.g. `mcp__common_tools_module__create_artifact`
— but the code matched a bare-name `Set` exactly
(`ARTIFACT_TOOL_NAMES.has(tc.tool_name)`). That `.has()` never returned
true, so `hasArtifactTools` was always false, `ArtifactToolCallCards`
never rendered, and `ensureArtifactLoaded` never fired.

**Fix:** replaced the exact-match `Set` with `isArtifactToolName()` —
matches the bare name OR a `…__<base>` suffix, so both qualified and
unqualified forms work. `ARTIFACT_TOOL_BASE_NAMES` must stay in sync
with the MCP tool names registered in `common_tools_module` — there is a
reciprocal comment on the tool implementations in `[[artifact_tool.py]]`
flagging this coupling.

(Sibling fix: `tool_output` itself must be clean JSON for the
`JSON.parse` here to work — see `[[output_transfer.py]]`.)

## 2026-05-13 — Phase C: 自动 reconnect 到后端在跑的 run

新增 useEffect 监听 `agentId + userId + currentAgent.active_run.run_id`：
当用户打开（或切换到）一个已经在后端跑着的 agent，前端立刻调
`reconnect(agentId, userId, activeRunId, agentName)`，让 `wsManager`
重开一条带 `run_id` 的 WS。后端识别到 run_id 就走 replay 分支：把
event_stream 里所有 seq ASC 的事件回放完，再 hook 到 broadcaster
拿 live 接续。

业内对这种模式的标准说法（用户在最近一次对话里直接问到）：
**resumable / replayable streaming session**——event_stream 是事件
存储（event sourcing），server-side run 是 long-running operation
(LRO)，WS reconnect = last-event-id-style resumption（W3C SSE 把它
做成 first-class，我们在 WS 上等价实现），整体是 "server-side
session continuity"。

useEffect 的边界条件（顺序 short-circuit）：
1. 没 agentId / userId → 直接返回（panel 还没 ready）
2. `activeRunId` 为 null → 后端没活跃 run，不重连（也是退出条件
   防止 run 结束后死循环）
3. 本地 `isLoading=true` → 当前 tab 自己刚发完 fresh-run 还在跑，
   wsManager 已经管理着一条 WS，**不能**再开一条；reconnect 也
   不需要——本地路径已经在收 live frames
4. 上述都不满足 → fire-and-forget `reconnect()`；`wsManager` 内部
   保证 idempotent（开新连接前 close 旧的）

依赖数组 `[agentId, userId, activeRunId]` 是关键：
- 用户切换 agent：activeRunId 跟着 currentAgent 变化（可能变 null
  或变成新 agent 的 run_id），effect 重跑
- run 结束后 `/api/auth/agents` 下一次拉到 active_run=null，
  activeRunId 变 null，effect 重跑后第 2 步退出 —— **不会**继续
  连旧 run

`reconnect` 故意从 deps 里排除（eslint-disable-next-line）——它在
hook 里是 useCallback 包过的稳定引用，写进去只会徒增噪音。

## 2026-05-11 fix — live activity stays visible after first reply (P0)

The streaming-state UI used to have two mutually exclusive render
branches:

1. `isStreaming && getUserVisibleResponse()` → render a streaming
   `MessageBubble` with the reply content. `thinking` and `toolCalls`
   are passed in but live inside the bubble's **collapsed** Reasoning
   / Tool-calls sections (`MessageBubble.tsx` initialises `showThinking`
   and `showTools` to `false`).
2. `isStreaming && !getUserVisibleResponse()` → render the "Live
   activity preview": italic streaming `currentThinking` text + a
   spinner-decorated list of in-flight `toolSteps`. **Always visible,
   no click required.**

The instant the agent called `send_message_to_user_directly` for the
first time, `getUserVisibleResponse()` flipped from `null` to a
string, branch 2 unmounted, and branch 1 took over. Any subsequent
thinking deltas or tool calls kept accumulating into
`chatStore.currentThinking` / `currentToolCalls` but had **no
always-visible UI surface** — the reply bubble looked finished even
when the agent was still mid-loop running more tools. Xiong's P0
"先回复一条信息后，不再显示思考过程" (`recvjhejbs2abv`).

Fix: drop the `!getUserVisibleResponse()` gate so the live activity
preview now stays mounted for the **entire** streaming window. The
streaming MessageBubble keeps receiving `thinking` / `toolCalls` so a
user who clicks "Reasoning" mid-stream still sees the full trace; the
live preview below provides the always-visible "still working" signal
until `stopStreaming` flips `isStreaming` to false (at which point the
bubble persists into history with its data already attached, line
269-270 of `chatStore.ts`). The `toolSteps` filter (regex
`/^3\.4\.\d+$/` minus `*.send_message_to_user_directly`) intentionally
drops the reply tool call so the same action doesn't appear twice
(once as the bubble, once as a tool step).

Defensive guard: inside the live preview, the `!hasActivity` fallback
now renders the "Starting up..." banner only when
`!getUserVisibleResponse()`. Without this, an LLM that emits no
`agent_thinking` deltas and whose only progress step is the
send_message tool call itself (which `toolSteps` filters out) would
land on `hasActivity=false` *after* a reply already rendered above —
visually contradicting "Starting up..." beneath a populated reply
bubble. With the guard, the live preview cleanly disappears in that
rare path instead.

# ChatPanel.tsx — Unified timeline chat surface with streaming and history pagination

## 为什么存在

The primary user-facing interface. All agent interaction goes through here. Merges two data sources (DB history and live WebSocket session) into a single chronologically ordered `TimelineItem[]` so the user sees one seamless conversation regardless of how many messages have been paginated or how the current run is progressing.

## 上下游关系
- **被谁用**: `MainLayout.ChatView`.
- **依赖谁**: `MessageBubble`, `EmbeddingBanner`, `useChatStore`, `useConfigStore`, `useAgentWebSocket`, `api.getSimpleChatHistory`.

## 设计决策

**Unified timeline**: History messages and session messages are merged and sorted by timestamp. Dedup is done by `role:content` key + 60-second timestamp-proximity check. **Match-and-consume semantics (Bug 19 fix)**: once a session message pairs with a history timestamp, that timestamp is spliced out of the per-key array so it can't dedup another session message with the same role+content. Without consumption, a single history row would gobble multiple session messages — realistic trigger is "user retries the exact same question after a failed turn", which would silently drop the retry bubble from the UI. Plan B (event_id-based precise dedup) is logged in `reference/self_notebook/todo/waiting/chat_dedup_by_event_id.md` as a future upgrade.

**Polling**: A 12-second interval polls for new background messages (from non-chat agent runs like Jobs). It only replaces the tail of history to avoid losing scroll position for users who've loaded older messages.

**Auto-load when not scrollable**: If the initial history page doesn't fill the container, the panel automatically calls `loadMoreHistory` until the container is scrollable. This prevents the "infinite scroll trigger never fires" problem when messages are small.

**IME handling**: The send button is gated by `isComposing` and a 100ms grace period after `compositionend`. Without this, CJK input methods would fire Enter before the character is committed.

**Bootstrap greeting**: If `bootstrap_active` is true and there are no messages, the panel renders a hard-coded bootstrap greeting. The greeting content is kept in sync with `src/xyz_agent_context/bootstrap/template.py` — comment in the code flags this dependency.

**`send_message_to_user_directly` filtering**: Tool calls with this name are filtered out of the streaming step preview — they produce the main message content, not a tool activity row.

## Gotcha / 边界情况

`flushSync` is used when prepending older messages after "load more" — this forces React to update the DOM synchronously before the scroll position is restored. Without `flushSync`, the scroll restoration would measure the old `scrollHeight`.

The `shouldAutoScrollRef` is the gating mechanism for scroll behavior. User scrolling up disables auto-scroll; new messages re-enable it; streaming start re-enables it.

**Two-mode scroll (Bug 15)**: scroll-to-bottom is split into two effects because "initial open" and "streaming tick" have incompatible requirements. `initialScrollPendingRef` is raised whenever fresh content arrives (initial load, agent switch, background poll, user's own submitted message). A dedicated effect picks it up, waits one `requestAnimationFrame` so `MessageBubble` subtrees (markdown, code blocks, tool-call UI) get a frame to lay out, then snaps `container.scrollTop = container.scrollHeight` — instant, not smooth, and scoped to `scrollContainerRef` only (scrollIntoView on a sentinel would also scroll ancestor containers). The streaming effect uses the classic smooth `scrollIntoView` + sentinel, gated by `isStreaming`, because during streaming the deltas are small and smooth feels right. If you ever need to "jump to bottom" from a new code path, set `initialScrollPendingRef.current = true` — do NOT reach for `scrollIntoView` directly (smooth loses the race against async content layout; that was the Bug 15 root cause).

## v2.4 改动（2026-05-08）— Inline artifact preview cards

- **`ArtifactToolCallCards` component**: a file-local component that receives `toolCalls: AgentToolCall[]`, `agentId`, and `allArtifacts` (pre-read from the store at component scope — not inside the map callback). For each tool call where `tool_name ∈ {create_artifact, upload_artifact_file}` and `tool_output` parses as JSON with an `artifact_id`, it renders an `ArtifactPreviewCard`. While the artifact is not yet in the store, it shows a "Loading artifact…" placeholder and fires `ensureArtifactLoaded` (fire-and-forget fetch → upsert).
- **`ensureArtifactLoaded` helper**: a module-level function (not a hook) that checks `useArtifactStore.getState().artifacts` for the given `artifact_id`. If absent, calls `artifactsApi.getDetail` and upserts the result. Safe to call on every render because the store lookup short-circuits immediately when already cached.
- **Hook rule compliance**: `allArtifacts` is read via `useArtifactStore((s) => s.artifacts)` at the `ChatPanel` component scope (top-level hook call), then passed down as a prop. This avoids calling a hook inside the `timeline.map()` callback.
- **Placement**: `ArtifactToolCallCards` is rendered as a sibling of `MessageBubble` inside each timeline item's wrapper `<div>`, so the cards appear below the message bubble.

## 新人易踩的坑

`BOOTSTRAP_GREETING` must be kept in sync with the Python backend constant. It's a frontend-only rendering shortcut — the greeting is never actually stored as a chat message until the user replies.

**Artifact preview placement**: the `ArtifactToolCallCards` render is gated by `hasArtifactTools`, which checks `item.role === 'assistant'`, `agentId` being truthy, and at least one qualifying tool call. This prevents the component from mounting on user messages or when `agentId` is not yet set. The `allArtifacts` dependency means the cards re-render when the store updates (e.g., after `ensureArtifactLoaded` upserts the fetched artifact), replacing the placeholder with the real card automatically.
