## 2026-05-14 — workspace tree viewer + manual register

Spec: `reference/self_notebook/specs/2026-05-14-artifact-pointer-model-design.md`

The flat file list became a **collapsible directory tree** (the backend
already filters dotfolders, so the UI doesn't need to). Per-file actions:

- **Download** — `<a href download>` against `api.workspaceFileRawUrl`.
- **Preview** — opens a `Dialog` and fetches the file via
  `api.fetchWorkspaceFileBlob`. Text files (md/csv/json/txt/html/code) are
  shown in a `<pre>`; images in `<img>`; everything else surfaces a
  "preview unavailable, download instead" message. Text preview is capped
  at 200 KB to keep huge files from freezing the modal.
- **Register as artifact** — opens a `Dialog` with `kind` (auto-detected
  from extension, editable) + `title` (default = filename without ext),
  then calls `artifactsApi.registerFromWorkspace`. Same runner the MCP
  tool uses, so validation is identical (path must live in a workspace
  subdirectory, kind whitelist, quota).
- **Delete** — works on both files and directories (recursive); confirms
  via `useConfirm` before issuing the DELETE.

Top-level drag-and-drop / file-picker upload is unchanged.

# FileUpload.tsx — Workspace tree viewer (config panel)

Hosts the workspace section of the agent config drawer. Lets the user
browse, preview, download, register-as-artifact, delete files and folders
in the agent's workspace, and drag-drop new files into the root.

Used inside `AwarenessPanel`. Owns its own local tree state (no
`usePreloadStore`).
