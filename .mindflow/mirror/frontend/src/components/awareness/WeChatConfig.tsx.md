# WeChatConfig.tsx — Per-agent WeChat (iLink) binding UI

## Why it exists

The Settings → Awareness panel slot for binding a WeChat account to the
current agent via the iLink bridge. Collects the required credentials,
POSTs to the generic channel bind endpoint, and renders bound/unbound state
with an unbind action.

## Upstream / Downstream

- **Used by**: registered as the `wechat` row's `component` in
  `ui.channels` by `registerBuiltinChannels.ts` (owner
  `builtin.channels.wechat`); rendered by `IMChannelsSection` when that row
  is selected.
- **Props type**: `ChannelConfigProps` — imported directly from
  `@/platform/registries`, not re-exported through `IMChannelsSection.tsx`.
  See the 2026-09-07 entry below.
- **Calls**: `api.channel*('wechat', …)` generic channel endpoints.

## 2026-09-07 — import fixed to the registry, not a sibling component (I-8)

Previously imported `ChannelConfigProps` from `./IMChannelsSection`, which
merely re-exported the type from `@/platform/registries`. Fixed to import
straight from `@/platform/registries`; `IMChannelsSection.tsx` dropped the
re-export (same fix applied identically to all five sibling channel config
components).

## 2026-09-07 — disabling this builtin now actually works (I-2 follow-on)

`registerBuiltinChannels.ts`'s six `CHANNELS.register(...)` calls were
previously all guarded behind a single `if (!CHANNELS.has('lark'))`, so
disabling `builtin.channels.wechat` alone did not stop this row from
registering. Each row is now guarded on its own id.
