# consolidate.py — unified Agent Memory

LLM consolidation (9 processing rules, Hindsight-derived) distilling raw units into evolving observations, with adaptive-bisect resilience. Fully LLM+SQL, no vectors.

Part of the unified memory system (`refactor/agent-memory`). Full design,
data model, retrieval stack and migration: reference/self_notebook/specs/2026-06-03-agent-memory-unification-design.md. Mechanism vs policy split
(§3): the Engine holds the fixed lifecycle algorithm; each kind's Spec holds
policy. No vectors — recall is BM25 + grep + structured filters.
