## 2026-06-24 — IM identity-tenant: external subject scope

`_build_and_run_agent` no longer runs the turn as the agent owner. It now derives a
room-based external subject (`external_subject_id(channel, message.chat_id)`, see
[[external_identity.py]]) and calls the runtime with `user_id=subject_id`. The
`ext:` subject carries its own scope — `AgentRuntime._resolve_scope_user_id`
auto-detects it (no flag), so narrative / workspace / executor container all isolate
per external conversation (DM room → per-person, group room → per-group), and a job
the external user creates stays external too. It also
idempotently provisions a persistent `users` row for the subject
(`ensure_external_user`, best-effort). Billing still resolves off the agent owner
(agent_id-based, in AgentRuntime), so the owner pays. EVERY IM turn is treated as
external — owner-via-IM is not distinguished in this version. The owner is still
resolved (`_resolve_agent_owner`) but only to stamp the subject's metadata. See
[[agent_runtime.py]] `_resolve_scope_user_id` for the scope decision.

## Why it exists

Phase 1's centerpiece. Direct extraction of the channel-agnostic 80%
of ``LarkTrigger`` into a base class so Slack (Phase 3) and Telegram
(Phase 4) ship without re-implementing dedup, Worker Pool, audit log,
inbox writer, or credential watcher. Lark itself stays put in Phase 1
— Phase 2 will refactor it onto this base.

This is the locus of the architecture's "Pattern C: shared subscriber"
principle (see ``.mindflow/project/references/architecture.md``).

## Design decisions

- **6 abstract methods + 1 optional hook + 2 PUSH stubs.** Subclasses
  implement ``connect``, ``parse_event``, ``is_echo``,
  ``resolve_sender_name``, ``create_context_builder``,
  ``load_active_credentials``. The optional ``fetch_attachments`` hook
  (added in Phase 1a, default returns ``[]``) lets channels with media
  ingestion override without forcing text-only channels to do anything.
  PUSH-mode stubs (``handle_webhook``, ``verify_webhook``) raise
  ``NotImplementedError`` until Phase 6.
- **``_persist_attachment`` helper.** Lives in the base because the
  download → MIME sniff → on-disk store → optional STT path is fully
  channel-agnostic. Each channel subclass downloads bytes from its own
  SDK then hands them to this helper. Workspace path resolution mirrors
  WS upload exactly (``_resolve_agent_owner(agent_id) or agent_id``)
  so the agent's Read tool finds the file at the same path the
  attachment was written to.
- **Attachment list flows via ``trigger_extra_data["attachments"]``.**
  Mirrors ``backend/routes/websocket.py:644-648`` so ChatModule's
  ``hook_data_gathering`` (which reads
  ``ctx_data.extra_data["attachments"]``) treats IM-uploaded and
  WS-uploaded files identically. The base only sets the key when the
  list is non-empty — keeps text-only audits noise-free.

- **Caption-less file uploads MUST flow** (Phase 1b regression-fix).
  The empty-content guard in ``_process_message``:
  ``if not message.content.strip(): return`` was originally written
  in Phase 1a when ParsedMessage was text-only — an empty content
  was a clear no-op. Phase 1b made files first-class, but the guard
  wasn't updated. Real-world failure mode: user drag-drops a PDF
  into Slack DM without typing anything → ``text=""`` +
  ``files=[...]``. parse_event correctly extracted ``attachment_refs``
  into ``raw``, but the base guard cut the message off BEFORE
  ``fetch_attachments`` could ever run, with NO audit row at all
  (the audit trail just stopped at ``debounce_merged``). The guard
  now keeps the early-return only when BOTH ``content`` is empty
  AND ``raw["attachment_refs"]`` is empty. Pin tested by
  ``tests/channel/test_attachment_fetch_pipeline.py::test_caption_less_file_upload_still_processed``.
- **Lazy AgentRuntime import.** Eager top-level import causes a
  circular load: ``channel/__init__.py`` re-exports
  ``ChannelTriggerBase`` for ergonomic use, but
  ``module/__init__.py`` (loading LarkModule) reaches the channel
  package first, so importing AgentRuntime here would re-enter the
  partially-initialised module package. Lazy-loading inside
  ``_build_and_run_agent`` breaks the cycle without forcing callers
  to import from the longer ``channel.channel_trigger_base`` path.
- **Tunable class attributes, not constructor args.** ``MIN_WORKERS``,
  ``MAX_WORKERS``, ``PROCESS_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` etc. are class
  attributes so subclasses can override them in 1 line; constructor
  args reserved for instance state (``base_workers``,
  ``history_config``).
- **``_subscriber_key`` override hook.** Defaults to
  ``credential.app_id`` (Lark today). Slack workspace install can
  serve multiple agents per ``team_id``; that channel will override
  to a compound key without changing the base.
- **Owner resolution via ``agents.created_by``.** AgentRuntime needs
  the agent's OWNER user_id to map provider quotas, NEVER the IM
  sender_id. This bug bit Lark previously and is fixed once here.
- **Per-message timeout, not just stream timeout.** The 30-min
  ``PROCESS_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` cap exists because
  ``collect_run`` only times out on stream silence, not total
  wall-clock — without this a stuck LLM call could occupy a worker
  forever.
- **``_prune_dead_workers`` between sizing decisions.** A worker that
  silently dies (cancellation leak, async-for oddity) would otherwise
  keep ``_adjust_workers`` from spawning a replacement, leaving the
  queue to grow unbounded. Lark's H-4 fix preserved here.
- **Credential cache is refreshed every poll, not just on subscriber
  start.** The credential is a DB snapshot whose ``permission_state`` /
  ``auth_status`` change mid-session — most importantly when the owner
  completes the three-click user authorization, which is what flips
  ``LarkCredential.user_oauth_ok()`` and lets ``resolve_sender_name``
  read names via the user token. The transport (``connect``) captures
  its credential once and the long-lived stream never re-reads it, so
  ``_credential_watcher`` overwrites ``_subscriber_creds[key]`` with the
  fresh DB snapshot on every poll, and ``_worker`` re-resolves the
  credential from that cache at dequeue time. Net effect: a mid-session
  auth completion (or any credential change) takes effect on the next
  message without restarting the subscriber or dropping the connection.
  Found on EC2: every Lark sender stayed "Unknown" because the running
  subscriber was started before the owner finished authorizing.

## Upstream / downstream

- **Upstream**: subclasses (Phase 2 will rebase ``LarkTrigger``;
  Phase 3 adds ``SlackTrigger``; Phase 4 adds ``TelegramTrigger``).
- **Downstream**:
  - ``ChannelDedupStore`` (3-layer dedup)
  - ``ChannelDebounceMerger`` (optional)
  - ``ChannelInboxWriter`` (5-row bundle)
  - ``ChannelTriggerAuditRepository`` (audit log)
  - ``ChannelSeenMessageRepository`` (durable dedup, owned by the
    dedup store)
  - ``AgentRuntime`` + ``collect_run`` (lazy import)
  - ``ChannelTag`` (prompt injection)

## Gotchas

- ``working_source`` defaults to ``WorkingSource.CHAT`` because every
  enum value must exist before the subclass picks one — Phase 1
  doesn't add ``WorkingSource.SLACK`` etc. Subclasses MUST set this
  to a meaningful value before ``start()``.
- ``handle_webhook`` raises ``NotImplementedError`` with a Phase-6
  reference — do NOT remove the references; webhooks need both
  HTTP routing AND a per-channel parser, neither of which is built.
- ``stop()`` flushes any debounce-buffered messages then drops them
  with a log line. We don't try to enqueue them on shutdown because
  the credential context (set per-flush in
  ``_enqueue_or_debounce``'s closure) isn't reachable from
  ``flush_all``. If a future channel really needs strict shutdown
  drain semantics, encode the credential into ParsedMessage.raw and
  reconstruct in ``_enqueue_debounced``.
