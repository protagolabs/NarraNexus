## Why it exists

The ``narra_cli`` MCP tool is a passthrough: it hands an arbitrary
command string to the ``narra-cli`` binary. This module is what makes
that safe. It mirrors ``lark_module/_lark_command_security.py`` but the
surface is far smaller (narra-cli has ~6 domains), so the whitelist is
short and hand-auditable.

## Design decisions

- **Whitelist by domain, not per-command wrapping.** ``ALLOWED_DOMAINS``
  gates the first token (``room`` / ``im`` / ``speech`` / ``explore`` /
  ``status`` / ``help``). New subcommands/flags under an allowed domain
  pass with zero code change — that is the whole durability point. A new
  *top-level domain* is the only CLI-growth event that needs a one-line
  whitelist add.
- **``BLOCKED_PATTERNS`` carve out what must not go through passthrough.**
  ``configure`` (endpoint is platform-global), ``doctor`` (probe surface),
  and — TRANSITIONALLY — ``im send``. ``im send`` is blocked because the
  send/media path stays on the Matrix-direct dedicated tools
  (``narra_reply`` / ``narra_send`` / ``narra_send_media``) until the
  proxy media path's moderation / compound / failure behaviour is
  validated on dev (owner decision 2026-07-20). ``im messages`` /
  ``im attachments`` are NOT matched by the ``im send`` prefix and remain
  allowed. Remove this block (and the dedicated send tools) once proxy
  send/media is verified.
- **``BLOCKED_FLAGS`` = ``--token`` / ``--token-file``.** The platform
  injects the bearer per call (see [[narra_cli_client]]); an agent
  supplying its own is either overriding our injection or probing for a
  readable path — always rejected.
- **``explore`` is official-agents-only.** Gated behind ``is_official``
  (default False). No official-agent marker is wired on the credential
  yet, so explore is currently blocked for everyone — safe default;
  wire ``is_official`` through when such a marker exists.
- **``shlex.split`` + ``shell=False`` argv is the real injection defense,
  NOT a shell-metachar denylist.** Under ``execve`` the metachars are
  literal; a denylist would only break legitimate content ("S&P 500",
  "$76,000", markdown tables) — the exact lesson already burned in on the
  Lark side. ``sanitize_command`` also expands ``\n``/``\t``/``\r`` so an
  LLM-written ``--text "a\nb"`` renders a real newline.

## Upstream / downstream

- **Called by**: ``_narramessenger_mcp_tools.narra_cli`` (validate →
  sanitize → run).
- Independent (binding rule #3): no cross-module imports; a shape-twin of
  the Lark security layer, not a shared one.

## Gotchas

- Ordering: ``BLOCKED_PATTERNS`` is checked before ``BLOCKED_FLAGS``, so a
  command that is both blocked-pattern and carries a token flag reports
  the pattern reason. Both reject — the reason string is the only
  difference.
- When the send tools are eventually removed, drop ``"im send"`` from
  ``BLOCKED_PATTERNS`` in the same change.
