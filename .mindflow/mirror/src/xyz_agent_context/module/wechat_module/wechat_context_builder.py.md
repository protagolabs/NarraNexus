## 2026-07-03 — reply instruction warns against emoji

The gateway silently drops messages containing astral-plane emoji (see
wechat_sdk_client.md same date). The reply_instruction now tells the agent
not to use emoji; sanitize_bmp in the SDK is the hard safety net.

## Why it exists

WeChat-side implementation of ``ChannelContextBuilderBase``. Builds the
per-turn context the agent sees when an iLink (personal-WeChat) message
lands: sender identity, room metadata, the inbound body, conversation
history, and the exact ``wechat_send`` invocation the agent must use to
reply.

Mirrors ``telegram_module/telegram_context_builder.py``. iLink, like
the Telegram Bot API, exposes **no server-side history endpoint**, so
the conversation-history path falls back to the local database.

## Design decisions

- **History comes from the local ``bus_messages`` table, keyed
  ``channel_id = f"wechat_{chat_id}"``.** The iLink gateway has no
  ``conversations.history`` equivalent — a bot only sees messages that
  arrive while it long-polls. So ``get_conversation_history`` reads the
  rows ``ChannelInboxWriter`` already persisted under
  ``wechat_{to_user_id}`` (here ``chat_id`` IS the ``to_user_id`` of the
  DM partner). Telegram returns ``[]`` unconditionally for the same
  "no history API" reason but does **not** read local history; WeChat
  goes one step further and surfaces the local turns, because for a
  1:1 personal DM the local ``bus_messages`` rows ARE the full
  conversation.
- **History is best-effort and never raises.** The fetch is wrapped so a
  DB error logs a warning and returns ``[]`` rather than failing the
  turn. History is a nicety; the inbound message and reply contract are
  what must always be present.
- **History over-fetches then trims.** It pulls ``max(limit + 5, 10)``
  rows ``ORDER BY created_at DESC``, drops the current inbound message
  (matched on ``message_id`` so the agent doesn't see its own trigger
  echoed as history), normalises sender to ``"Me (bot)"`` vs the DM
  partner, re-orders oldest-first, then trims to ``limit``. The +5 / 10
  headroom absorbs the dropped current message and any bot rows.
- **``room_type = "Direct Message"`` always.** v1 is personal-account,
  1:1 DM only — there is no group path. This is hard-coded rather than
  derived, because the integration has no group concept to derive from
  (contrast Telegram, which infers group vs DM from the ``chat_id``
  sign).
- **``get_room_members`` returns ``[]``.** 1:1 DM — no member set to
  enumerate.
- **``reply_instruction`` hand-builds the ``wechat_send`` call.** It is
  pre-formatted with the actual ``to_user_id`` and ``context_token``
  pulled from the inbound message's ``raw``, so the agent calls
  ``wechat_send(to_user_id, context_token, text)`` without re-deriving
  them. The ``context_token`` is the gateway's per-inbound reply token —
  it must be echoed back on send or the gateway rejects the reply
  (stale-token ``ret != 0``).
- **The plain-text warning lives inline in ``reply_instruction``.**
  WeChat has no markdown rendering, so asterisks / backticks show up
  literally. The warning is placed at the call site (not only in the
  system prompt) so it reaches the agent where it actually composes the
  reply. The instruction also pins "Send exactly ONE message".
- **``send_tool_name = "wechat_send"``.** The
  ``ChannelContextBuilderBase`` contract surfaces the canonical send
  tool by name so the templated ``message_info`` can reference it.
  Telegram uses ``tg_cli``; Slack uses ``slack_send``; Lark uses
  ``lark_cli``.
- **``room_name`` left empty.** Personal-DM partners don't carry a room
  title; the renderer treats empty string as "use ``room_id``" (the
  ``to_user_id``).
- **Holds raw ``ParsedMessage`` + ``WeChatCredential``, reads lazily.**
  No copy / transform of fields, so future ``ParsedMessage`` extensions
  appear without touching this file.

## Upstream / downstream

- **Upstream**: ``ChannelContextBuilderBase``.
- **Constructed by**: ``WeChatTrigger`` (create-context-builder path),
  which passes the ``db_client`` needed for history.
- **Reads**: ``ParsedMessage``, ``WeChatCredential``, and the
  ``bus_messages`` table.

## Gotchas

- **History silently empties if ``db_client`` is missing.** The
  constructor allows ``db_client = None``; with no db (or no
  ``chat_id``) ``get_conversation_history`` returns ``[]`` with no
  warning. If history looks unexpectedly empty, check the trigger
  actually threaded the db client in.
- **``channel_id`` key must match what ``ChannelInboxWriter`` writes.**
  History reads ``wechat_{chat_id}``; if the inbox writer ever changes
  its channel-id scheme, history goes silently empty (the fetch
  succeeds, returns zero rows). Keep the two in sync.
- **``context_token`` is per-inbound and expires.** It's read from the
  inbound ``raw`` and baked into ``reply_instruction``. A reply that
  reuses a stale token (e.g. the agent replies to an old turn) will be
  rejected by the gateway with ``ret != 0`` and surface as a failed
  send.
- **``room_type`` is hard-coded "Direct Message".** If WeChat group
  support is ever added, this becomes a real branch — today it is
  correct precisely because v1 is DM-only.
