## 2026-06-10 — helper obtained via get_helper_sdk()

The fallback-reply stream no longer instantiates OpenAIAgentsSDK directly —
`get_helper_sdk()` (agent_framework/helper_sdk.py) returns the per-task
helper (OpenAI or Anthropic Messages API) based on which helper config the
resolver installed. Call shape (llm_stream) unchanged.


## 2026-05-29 — pluggable driver + EverMemOS removed

The agent loop is now obtained via `get_agent_loop_driver(working_path=...)`
(framework registry, iron rule #9) — do NOT instantiate `ClaudeAgentSDK`
directly here; register a driver instead (see [[agent_loop_driver.py]]).
The former EverMemOS episode await (`ctx.evermemos_task` → `relevant_episodes`
→ `context_runtime.run`) was removed.

## 2026-05-25 — Fatal-path recovery wired end-to-end (`_stream_fallback_recovery`)

The post-agent-loop recovery slot is now a single async generator that:

1. Drains the helper_llm stream as `AgentTextDelta` frames (when mode is `no_reply` or `after_error`).
2. Emits a synthetic `send_message_to_user_directly` `ProgressMessage` carrying `details.reply_via=helper_llm_{mode}` if any content streamed — downstream `chat_module._split_user_visible_response` picks this up like an organic reply, so persistence works without special-casing.
3. Yields the captured `ErrorMessage` LAST with computed severity (`recovered` / `recovered_after_reply` / `fatal`). The frontend reduces synthetic tool calls into `responseParts` first; yielding the error first would briefly flip `displayContent` to the error string before the synthetic lands.

The `except Exception` in the main agent-loop body **no longer yields** the ErrorMessage immediately — it stashes `{error_type, error_message}` into `captured_error` so the recovery generator can place it after the recovered reply. `_generate_fallback_reply_stream` now accepts the full context (system prompts + chat history + agent_loop_response + final_output + error_info) and uses one of two prompt templates (`_FALLBACK_NO_REPLY_INSTRUCTIONS` / `_FALLBACK_AFTER_ERROR_INSTRUCTIONS`); `_build_helper_user_input` assembles the user-input payload via tagged XML-ish sections so the LLM can navigate the context without re-instantiating the agent persona.

Rename: synthetic `details.reply_via` switched from `helper_llm_fallback` to `helper_llm_no_reply` / `helper_llm_after_error` so the UI can distinguish the two recovery modes. `chat_module` now copies any `helper_llm_*` tag onto the persisted row (was strict equality on `helper_llm_fallback`).

Contract is pinned by `tests/agent_runtime/test_fallback_streaming_order.py`.

## 2026-05-25 — Mode-aware fallback decision (`_should_run_helper_llm_fallback`)

Return shape changed from `(bool, str)` to `(mode | None, str)`:

- `"no_reply"` — chat turn ended cleanly without `send_message_to_user_directly`; helper_llm runs to write the missing reply.
- `"after_error"` — chat turn hit a fatal mid-stream and no organic reply was sent yet; helper_llm runs with full context (system prompts + completed tool results + error info) to produce a recovery reply. (Wired in T4.)
- `"partial_reply_then_error"` — fatal hit AFTER an organic reply; helper_llm does NOT run (we already spoke), but the caller surfaces a `recovered_after_reply` ErrorMessage. (Wired in T4.)
- `None` with `skip_reason` — `non_chat_trigger` / `cancellation_requested` / `already_replied_via_tool`.

The decision function is now the single point of truth for "what should this turn do at the recovery slot." Contract is pinned by `tests/agent_runtime/test_helper_llm_fallback_decision.py`.

## 2026-05-25 — Fallback prompt serializer added (`_serialize_agent_loop_for_prompt`)

Pure helper that renders `agent_loop_response` (raw runtime frames) into
a flat ordered plain-text block for the helper_llm fallback prompt. Sits
beside `_should_run_helper_llm_fallback` — both are no-IO, no-async, so
the recovery prompt assembly is unit-testable end-to-end without
spinning up the full async generator.

Per-entry cap defaults to 4 KB, total cap to 32 KB. When total exceeds
the cap, oldest entries drop first (with an `[... earlier activity
omitted ...]` marker) because the recovery reply needs recent activity
more than ancient setup. Adjacent `AgentTextDelta` frames coalesce into
one `[assistant_text]` block so the LLM sees coherent text instead of
the delta soup that's natural for streaming. See spec
`reference/self_notebook/specs/2026-05-25-fallback-llm-context-design.md`
for the bigger redesign this enables (fatal-path recovery with full
context).

Contract is pinned by `tests/agent_runtime/test_fallback_prompt_assembly.py`.

## 2026-05-13 — Phase B caller migration (generator-based ResponseProcessor)

`ResponseProcessor.process(...)` 在 Phase B 改成 generator。这里的 caller
从 `result = response_processor.process(response, state)` 改成 `for result
in response_processor.process(response, state):`——一个 raw event 可能
产生 0..2 个 ProcessedResponse（thinking 累积时是 0，非 thinking 事件
flush 残余 thinking 时是 2）。

同时在两个出口点（try 末尾 + except 中）调 `flush_pending(state)`——保证
stream 结束 / 异常退出时 batcher 里残留的 thinking 不丢。这是 batcher 设计
明确要求 caller 履行的契约。

## 2026-05-12 — Chat no-reply helper_llm fallback hardening

Self-review of the initial fallback (same-day) caught four real holes;
the fixes are pinned by
`tests/agent_runtime/test_helper_llm_fallback_decision.py`:

1. **Fatal error must skip the fallback**. If `agent_loop_response`
   contains an ErrorMessage with `severity="fatal"` (CLI timeout, SDK
   crash, etc.), `state.final_output` is partial reasoning; asking
   helper_llm to summarise that hallucinates a reply from a half-
   thought. chat_module's failed-turn path handles it instead.
2. **Cancellation must skip — and abort mid-stream**. If the user
   pressed stop, honouring the token is the whole point. The
   pre-check + a mid-loop check on the streaming iteration cover
   both "cancelled before fallback fires" and "cancelled mid-stream".
3. **`state.finalize()` runs before reading `state.final_output`**.
   The previous order read the unfinalized state.
4. **Partial-stream recovery**. If helper_llm errors after some
   deltas have already been yielded, the synthetic ProgressMessage
   is still emitted from `fallback_chunks`, tagged
   `details.fallback_partial=True` + `details.fallback_error`. The
   user keeps the visible deltas and chat_module persists the matching
   partial content — no half-reply + "decided not to respond"
   mismatch in DB.

The skip decision is factored into a pure function
`_should_run_helper_llm_fallback(working_source, agent_loop_response,
cancellation) -> (bool, skip_reason)` so the four guard cases can be
exercised by unit tests without spinning up the full async generator.

## 2026-05-12 — Chat no-reply helper_llm fallback (P0 #3)

After the agent loop completes, step 3 now inspects
`agent_loop_response` for a `send_message_to_user_directly` tool call.
When the turn was chat-triggered (`ctx.working_source == "chat"`) and
no such call exists, step 3 invokes the helper_llm slot via
`OpenAIAgentsSDK.llm_stream` and streams the resulting reply through
`AgentTextDelta` events — exactly the same channel the frontend uses
to render organic LLM stream, so users see the recovered reply in
real time without any frontend change.

After the stream completes, step 3 appends a synthetic
`send_message_to_user_directly` ProgressMessage carrying
`details.reply_via="helper_llm_fallback"`. Downstream:
- `ChatModule._extract_user_visible_response` picks the synthetic call
  up like any organic reply, so the assistant row persists the
  helper-generated text — NOT `io_data.final_output` (reasoning).
- `ChatModule.hook_after_event_execution` lifts the `reply_via` tag
  onto the persisted row's `meta_data.reply_via`.

Why this design (per 5/11 product review):
- `io_data.final_output` is internal reasoning, not speech (project
  iron rule: only `send_message_to_user_directly` counts as speaking).
  The previous "persist final_output directly" shortcut violated this.
- Only chat turns get the fallback. `message_bus` deliberately avoids
  replying to prevent agent-to-agent loops; job/lark/etc. have their
  own reply pathways.
- Streaming the helper_llm output keeps the user experience identical
  to a normal reply (no "blank then long pause then text" UX).

If the helper_llm call itself fails, step 3 logs and lets the
placeholder fall through — the honest record is "no reply" rather
than a silent leak of reasoning.

# step_3_agent_loop.py — Pipeline Step 3 Sub-path: Interactive Agent Loop

## Why It Exists

When `step_3_execute_path.py` routes to the `agent_loop` execution type, this module handles the full sub-pipeline for an interactive LLM-driven turn. It orchestrates sub-steps 3.1 through 3.5: context building, token budget computation, LLM invocation, tool execution, and response processing. This separation keeps the routing layer thin and the agent loop logic focused.

## Upstream / Downstream

**Called by:** `step_3_execute_path.py` — receives `ctx` and yields `ProgressMessage` + `PathExecutionResult`

**Calls:**
- `ContextRuntime.run()` (sub-step 3.2) — builds `ContextData` with all module data injected
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.agent_loop()` (sub-step 3.3) — drives the LLM turn via Claude Code CLI subprocess
- `ResponseProcessor.process()` (sub-step 3.5) — interprets LLM output into `ProcessedResponse`
- `ctx.module_service` — for hook calls between sub-steps

**Produces:** `PathExecutionResult` stored in `ctx.execution_result` by the calling router

## Key Design Decisions

### Sub-step Structure (3.1–3.5)
Each sub-step yields its own `ProgressMessage`. This gives the frontend granular visibility into long-running turns. The sub-step numbers appear in WebSocket progress events, allowing the UI to show "3.3 Calling LLM..." independently.

### skill_env_vars Extraction
`ctx_data.extra_data` is checked for `skill_env_vars` key after ContextRuntime runs. These env vars come from AwarenessModule and are passed directly to the Claude Code CLI subprocess. This is how agent-level tool permissions (e.g., allowed bash commands) propagate to the execution environment.

### Token Budget
Computed before the LLM call from `ctx.event.input_content` length and the loaded context. Budget calculation lives here, not in ContextRuntime, because it depends on the final assembled prompt length.

### Multi-turn History Injection
Chat history is injected into the system prompt (not as native multi-turn messages) because Claude Code CLI's `--system-prompt` flag doesn't support multi-turn natively. The `prompts.py` constants (`CHAT_HISTORY_HEADER`, etc.) wrap the history block.

## ContextData Mutations

| Field | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| `ctx_data` | Built fresh by ContextRuntime; not a pre-existing ctx field |
| `ctx.execution_result` | Set by router after this generator yields `PathExecutionResult` |
| `ctx.evermemos_memories` | Read here (cached in step 1); passed to ContextRuntime |

## Gotchas / Edge Cases

- **skill_env_vars missing key**: If AwarenessModule didn't populate `extra_data`, the dict lookup returns `None` gracefully — don't add a default, the SDK handles `None`.
- **ContextRuntime vs agent loop ordering**: ContextRuntime.run() must complete before agent_loop() starts; the context is not streamed incrementally.
- **Sub-step 3.4 (tool execution)**: Tool calls are processed inside `agent_loop()` via MCP — sub-step 3.4 in the progress messages is a checkpoint yield, not a separate function call.
- **ErrorMessage is appended to `agent_loop_response` AND yielded (Bug 8)**: the `except Exception` handler doesn't just push the error to the frontend — it also appends the `ErrorMessage` to `agent_loop_response` before moving on to `state.finalize()` and the `PathExecutionResult` yield. That append is what lets downstream hooks (ChatModule detects it in `hook_after_event_execution` and stores the failed turn with `meta_data.status="failed"` instead of a normal user/assistant pair) see the failure signal. Without the append, hooks see a silently-truncated turn and happily persist it as "success with empty reply", which was exactly the Bug 8 contamination.

## Common New-Developer Mistakes

- Trying to add module data gathering here: all data gathering belongs in `ContextRuntime` (which calls `hook_data_gathering` on each module). This step only orchestrates.
- Assuming `ctx.execution_result` is set inside this generator: the router (`step_3_execute_path.py`) sets it after intercepting the `PathExecutionResult` yield.
- Forgetting that `skill_env_vars` must be a `dict[str, str]` — passing any other type will cause the SDK subprocess to reject it silently.
