# services/skill_sync_service.py — skill 对账器

Keeps `skill_installations` (audit DB) following the filesystem truth.
Users can always hand-edit `skills/` — so the DB is a FOLLOWER: this
service ONLY writes DB rows, never touches user files (tested explicitly:
a reconcile pass leaves the tree byte-identical).

## Drift matrix

disk-only → row added (source from `.skill_meta.json`, else `manual`);
DB-installed but gone from disk → `external_removed` (row kept for audit);
content hash ≠ recorded `content_hash` → `modified`; under `.disabled/` →
`disabled`; back on disk → `installed` again. Idempotent: pass 2 is a
no-op. `uninstalled`/`external_removed` rows are terminal-stable (not
re-flagged every pass).

## Wiring

Runs inside the backend lifespan (`backend/main.py`): one startup pass +
`run_forever` loop (env `SKILL_SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, default 1800, 0
disables), cancelled on shutdown with a done-callback that logs unexpected
exits (fire-and-forget lesson #2). Lives in the backend process — both run
modes (run.sh / DMG sidecar) boot the same lifespan, iron rule #7.
`reconcile_all` walks the NESTED workspace layout `{user_id}/{agent_id}`
(see utils/workspace_paths.py `_LAYOUT`); if the layout flips again this
walk must follow.

Enable/disable via the UI routes does NOT write the audit table directly —
the reconciler is what converges those states (acceptable lag ≤ interval;
DB is audit-only).
