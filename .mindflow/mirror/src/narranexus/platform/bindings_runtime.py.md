# platform/bindings_runtime.py — resolving bindings at boot

`resolve_runtime_bindings(distribution, registries, environ, home, snapshot)`: default < distribution < `<plugin home>/narranexus.toml` < `NX_BIND__*` env; installs the result with `Registries.set_bindings` and snapshots `run/bindings.resolved.json`. Called by the backend, mcp and workers boots. `config_path()` names the user config file.
